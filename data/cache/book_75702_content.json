THE AMATEUR SAFE SMASHER On the night of May 27th, 1925, the office of Gilderheim, Pascoe and Company, diamond merchants, of Little Hatton Garden, presented no unusual appearance to the patrolling constable who examined the lock and tried the door in the ordinary course of his duty. Until nine o\u2019clock in the evening the office had been occupied by Mr. Gilderheim and his head clerk, and a plain clothes officer, whose duty it was to inquire into unusual happenings had deemed that the light in the window on the first floor fell within his scope, and had gone up to discover the reason for its appearance. The 27th was a Saturday, and it is usual for the offices in Hatton Garden to be clear of clerks and their principals by three at the latest. Mr. Gilderheim, a pleasant gentleman, had been relieved to discover that the knock which brought him to the door, gripping a revolver in his pocket in case of accidents, produced no more startling adventure than a chat with a police officer who was known to him. He explained that he had to-day received a parcel of diamonds from an Amsterdam house, and was classifying the stones before leaving for the night, and with a few jocular remarks on the temptation which sixty thousand pounds\u2019 worth of diamonds offered to the unscrupulous \u201cnight of darkness,\u201d the officer left. At nine-forty Mr. Gilderheim locked up the jewels in his big safe, before which an electric light burnt day and night, and accompanied by his clerk, left No. 93 Little Hatton Garden and walked in the direction of Holborn. The constable on point duty bade them good- night, and the plain clothes officer, who was then at the Holborn end of the thoroughfare, exchanged a word or two. \u201cYou will be on duty all night?\u201d asked Mr. Gilderheim as his clerk hailed a cab. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d said the officer. \u201cGood!\u201d said the merchant. \u201cI\u2019d like you to keep a special eye upon my place. I am rather nervous about leaving so large a sum in the safe.\u201d The officer smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t think you need worry, sir,\u201d he said, and after the cab containing Mr. Gilderheim had driven", "off he walked back to No. 93. But in that brief space of time between the diamond merchant leaving and the return of the detective many things had happened. Scarcely had Gilderheim reached the detective than two men walked briskly along the thoroughfare from the other end. Without hesitation the first turned into No. 93, opened the door with a key, and passed in. The second man followed. There was no hesitation, nothing furtive in their movements. They might have been lifelong tenants of the house, so confident were they in every action. Not half a minute after the second man had entered a third came from the same direction, turned into the building, unlocked the door with that calm confidence which had distinguished the action of the first comer, and went in. Three minutes later two of the three were upstairs. With extraordinary expedition one had produced two small iron bottles from his pockets and had deftly fixed the rubber tubes and adjusted the little blow-pipe of his lamp, and the second had spread out on the floor a small kit of tools of delicate temper and beautiful finish. Neither man spoke. They lay flat on the ground, making no attempt to extinguish the light which shone before the safe. They worked in silence for some little while, then the stouter of the two remarked, looking up at the reflector fixed at an angle to the ceiling and affording a view of the upper part of the safe to the passer-by in the street below-- \u201cEven the mirrors do not give us away, I suppose?\u201d The second burglar was a slight, young-looking man with a shock of hair that suggested the musician. He shook his head. \u201cUnless all the rules of optics have been specially reversed for the occasion,\u201d he said with just a trace of a foreign accent, \u201cwe cannot possibly be seen.\u201d \u201cI am relieved,\u201d said the first. He half whistled, half hummed a little tune to himself as he plied the hissing flame to the steel door. He was carefully burning out the lock, and had no doubt in his mind that he would succeed, for the safe was an old-fashioned one. No further word was exchanged for half an hour. The man with the blow-pipe continued in his work, the other watching with silent interest, ready to play his part when the operation was sufficiently advanced. At the end of half an hour the elder of the two wiped his streaming forehead with the back of his hand, for the heat which the flame gave back from the steel door was fairly trying. \u201cWhy did you make such a row closing the door?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou are not usually so careless, Calli.\u201d The other looked down at him in mild astonishment. \u201cI made no noise whatever, my dear George,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you had been standing in the passage you could not have heard it; in fact, I closed the door as noiselessly as I", "opened it.\u201d The perspiring man on the ground smiled. \u201cThat would be fairly noiseless,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy?\u201d asked the other. \u201cBecause I did not close it. You walked in after me.\u201d Something in the silence which greeted his words made him look up. There was a puzzled look upon his companion\u2019s face. \u201cI opened the door with my own key,\u201d said the younger man slowly. \u201cYou opened----\u201d The man called George frowned. \u201cI do not understand you, Callidino. I left the door open, and you walked in after me; I went straight up the stairs, and you followed.\u201d Callidino looked at the other and shook his head. \u201cI opened the door myself with the key,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIf anybody came in after you--why, it is up to us, George, to see who it is.\u201d \u201cYou mean----?\u201d \u201cI mean,\u201d said the little Italian, \u201cthat it would be extremely awkward if there is a third gentleman present on this inconvenient occasion.\u201d \u201cIt would, indeed,\u201d said the other. \u201cWhy?\u201d Both men turned with a start, for the voice that asked the question without any trace of emotion was the voice of a third man, and he stood in the doorway screened from all possibility of observation from the window by the angle of the room. He was dressed in an evening suit, and he carried a light overcoat across his arm. What manner of man he was, and how he looked, they had no means of judging, for from his chin to his forehead his face was covered by a black mask. \u201cPlease do not move,\u201d he said, \u201cand do not regard the revolver I am holding in the light of a menace. I merely carry it for self-defence, and you will admit that under the circumstances, and knowing the extreme delicacy of my position, I am fairly well justified in taking this precaution.\u201d George Wallis laughed a little under his breath. \u201cSir,\u201d he said, without shifting his position, \u201cyou may be a man after my own heart, but I shall know better when you have told me exactly what you want.\u201d \u201cI want to learn,\u201d said the stranger. He stood there regarding the pair with obvious interest. The eyes which shone through the holes of the mask were alive and keen. \u201cGo on with your work, please,\u201d he said. \u201cI should hate to interrupt you.\u201d George Wallis picked up the blow-pipe and addressed himself again to the safe door. He was a most adaptable man, and the situation in which he found himself nonplussed had yet to occur. \u201cSince,\u201d he said, \u201cit makes absolutely no difference as to whether I leave off or whether I go on, if you are a representative of law and order, I may as well go on, because if you are not a representative of those two admirable, excellent and necessary qualities I might at least save half the swag with you.\u201d \u201cYou may save the lot,\u201d said the man sharply. \u201cI do not wish to", "share the proceeds of your robbery, but I want to know how you do it--that is all.\u201d \u201cYou shall learn,\u201d said George Wallis, that most notorious of burglars, \u201cand at the hands of an expert, I beg you to believe.\u201d \u201cThat I know,\u201d said the other calmly. Wallis went on with his task apparently undisturbed by this extraordinary interruption. The little Italian\u2019s hands had twitched nervously, and here might have been trouble, but the strength of the other man, who was evidently the leader of the two, and his self- possession had heartened his companion to accept whatever consequences the presence of this man might threaten. It was the masked stranger who broke the silence. \u201cIsn\u2019t it an extraordinary thing,\u201d he said, \u201cthat whilst technical schools exist for teaching every kind of trade, art and craft, there is none which engage in teaching the art of destruction. Believe me, I am very grateful that I have had this opportunity of sitting at the feet of a master.\u201d His voice was not unpleasant, but there was a certain hardness which was not in harmony with the flippant tone he adopted. The man on the floor went on with his work for a little while, then he said without turning his head-- \u201cI am anxious to know exactly how you got in.\u201d \u201cI followed close behind you,\u201d said the masked man. \u201cI knew there would be a reasonable interval between the two of you. You see,\u201d he went on, \u201cyou have been watching this office for the greater part of a week; one of you has been on duty practically every night. You rented a small office higher up this street which offered a view of these premises. I gathered that you had chosen to-night because you brought your gas with you this morning. You were waiting in the dark hall-way of the building in which your office is situated, one of you watching for the light to go out and Mr. Gilderheim depart. When he had gone, you, sir\u201d--he addressed the man on the floor--\u201ccame out immediately, your companion did not follow so soon. Moreover, he stopped to pick up a small bundle of letters which had apparently been dropped by some careless person, and since these letters included two sealed packets such as the merchants of Hatton Garden send to their clients, I was able to escape the observation of the second man and keep reasonably close to you.\u201d Callidino laughed softly. \u201cThat is true,\u201d he said, with a nod to the man on the floor. \u201cIt was very clever. I suppose you dropped the packet?\u201d The masked man inclined his head. \u201cPlease go on,\u201d he said, \u201cdo not let me interrupt you.\u201d \u201cWhat is going to happen when I have finished?\u201d asked George, still keeping his face to the safe. \u201cAs far as I am concerned, nothing. Just as soon as you have got through your work, and have extracted whatever booty there is to be extracted, I shall", "retire.\u201d \u201cYou want your share, I suppose?\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d said the other calmly. \u201cI do not want my share by any means. I am not entitled to it. My position in society prevents me from going farther down the slippery path than to connive at your larceny.\u201d \u201cFelony,\u201d corrected the man on the floor. \u201cFelony,\u201d agreed the other. He waited until without a sound the heavy door of the safe swung open and George had put his hand inside to extract the contents, and then, without a word, he passed through the door, closing it behind him. The two men sat up tensely and listened. They heard nothing more until the soft thud of the outer door told them that their remarkable visitor had departed. They exchanged glances--interest on the one face, amusement on the other. \u201cThat is a remarkable man,\u201d said Callidino. The other nodded. \u201cMost remarkable,\u201d he said, \u201cand more remarkable will it be if we get out of Hatton Garden to-night with the loot.\u201d It would seem that the \u201cmore than most\u201d remarkable happening of all actually occurred, for none saw the jewel thieves go, and the smashing of Gilderheim\u2019s jewel safe provided an excellent alternative topic for conversation to the prospect of Sunstar for the Derby. CHAPTER II. SUNSTAR\u2019S DERBY There it was again! Above the babel of sound, the low roar of voices, soft and sorrowful, now heard, now lost, a vagrant thread of gold caught in the drab woof of shoddy life gleaming and vanishing.\u2026 Gilbert Standerton sat tensely straining to locate the sound. It was the \u201cMelody in F\u201d that the unseen musician played. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a storm.\u201d Gilbert did not hear the voice. He sat on the box-seat of the coach, clasping his knees, the perspiration streaming from his face. There was something tragic, something a little terrifying in his pose. The profile turned to his exasperated friend was a perfect one--forehead high and well-shaped, the nose a little long, perhaps, the chin strong and resolute. Leslie Frankfort, looking up at the unconscious dreamer, was reminded of the Dante of convention, though Dante never wore a top-hat or found a Derby Day crowd so entirely absorbing. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a storm.\u201d Leslie climbed up the short step- ladder, and swung himself into the seat by Gilbert\u2019s side. The other awoke from his reverie with a start. \u201cIs there?\u201d he asked, and wiped his forehead. Yet as he looked around it was not the murky clouds banking up over Banstead that held his eye; it was this packed mass of men and women, these gay placards extolling loudly the honesty and the establishment of \u201cthe old firm,\u201d the booths on the hill, the long succession of canvas screens which had been erected to advertise somebody\u2019s whisky, the flimsy-looking stands on the far side of the course, the bustle, the pandemonium and the vitality of that vast, uncountable throng made such things as June thunderstorms of little importance. \u201cIf you", "only knew how the low brows are pitying you,\u201d said Leslie Frankfort, with good-natured annoyance, \u201cyou would not be posing for a picture of \u2018The Ruined Gambler.\u2019 My dear chap, you look for all the world, sitting up here with your long, ugly mug adroop, like a model for the coloured plate to be issued with the Christmas Number of the Anti-Gambling Gazette. I suppose they have a gazette.\u201d Gilbert laughed a little. \u201cThese people interest me,\u201d he said, rousing himself to speak. \u201cDon\u2019t you realise what they all mean? Every one of them with a separate and distinct individuality, every one with a hope or a fear hugged tight in his bosom, every one with the capacity for love, or hate, or sorrow. Look at that man!\u201d he said, and pointed with his long, nervous finger. The man he indicated stood in a little oasis of green. Hereabouts the people on the course had so directed their movements as to leave an open space, and in the centre stood a man of medium height, a black bowler on the back of his head, a long, thin cigar between his white, even teeth. He was too far away for Leslie to distinguish these particulars, but Gilbert Standerton\u2019s imagination filled in the deficiencies of vision, for he had seen this man before. As if conscious of the scrutiny, the man turned and came slowly towards the rails where the coach stood. He took the cigar from his mouth and smiled as he recognised the occupant of the box-seat. \u201cHow do you do, sir?\u201d His voice sounded shrill and faint, as if an immeasurable distance separated them, but he was evidently shouting to raise his voice above the growling voices of the crowd. Gilbert waved his hand with a smile, and the man turned with a raise of his hat, and was swallowed up in a detachment of the crowd which came eddying about him. \u201cA thief,\u201d said Gilbert, \u201con a fairly large scale--his name is Wallis; there are many Wallises here. A crowd is a terrible spectacle to the man who thinks,\u201d he said half to himself. The other glanced at him keenly. \u201cThey\u2019re terrible things to get through in a thunderstorm,\u201d he said, practically. \u201cI vote we go along and claim the car.\u201d Gilbert nodded. He rose stiffly, like a man with cramp, and stepped slowly down the little ladder to the ground. They passed through the barrier and crossed the course, penetrated the little unsaddling enclosure, through the long passages where press-men, jockeys and stewards jostled one another every moment of race days, to the roadway without. In the roped garage they found their car, and, more remarkable, their chauffeur. The first flicker of blue lightning had stabbed twice to the Downs, and the heralding crash of thunder had reverberated through the charged air, when the car began to thread the traffic toward London. The storm, which had been brewing all the afternoon, broke with terrific fury over Epsom.", "The lightning was incessant, the rain streamed down in an almost solid wall of water, crash after crash of thunder deafened them. The great throng upon the hill was dissolving as though it was something soluble; its edges frayed into long black streamers of hurrying people moving toward the three railway stations. It required more than ordinary agility to extricate the car from the chaos of charabancs and motor-cabs in which it found itself. Standerton had taken his seat by the driver\u2019s side, though the car was a closed one. He was a man quick to observe, and on the second flash he had seen the chauffeur\u2019s face grow white and his lips twitching. A darkness almost as of night covered the heavens. The horizon about was rimmed with a dull, angry orange haze; so terrifying a storm had not been witnessed in England for many years. The rain was coming down in sheets, but the young man by the chauffeur\u2019s side paid no heed. He was watching the nervous hands of the man twist this way and that as the car made detour after detour to avoid the congested road. Suddenly a jagged streak of light flicked before the car, and Standerton was deafened by an explosion more terrifying than any of the previous peals. The chauffeur instinctively shrank back, his face white and drawn; his trembling hands left the wheel, and his foot released the pedal. The car would have come to a standstill, but for the fact that they were at the top of a declivity. \u201cMy God!\u201d he whimpered, \u201cit\u2019s awful. I can\u2019t go on, sir.\u201d Gilbert Standerton\u2019s hand was on the wheel, his neatly-booted foot had closed on the brake pedal. \u201cGet out of it!\u201d he muttered. \u201cGet over here, quick!\u201d The man obeyed. He moved shivering to his master\u2019s place, his hands before his face, and Standerton slipped into the driver\u2019s seat and threw in the clutch. It was fortunate that he was a driver of extraordinary ability, but he needed every scrap of knowledge as he put the car to the slope which led to the lumpy Downs. As they jolted forward the downpour increased, the ground was running with water as though it had been recently flooded. The wheels of the car slipped and skidded over the greasy surface, but the man at the steering-wheel kept his head, and by and by he brought the big car slithering down a little slope on to the main way again. The road was sprinkled with hurrying, tramping people. He moved forward slowly, his horn sounding all the time, and then of a sudden the car stopped with a jerk. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Leslie Frankfort had opened the window which separated the driver\u2019s seat from the occupants of the car. \u201cThere\u2019s an old chap there,\u201d said Gilbert, speaking over his shoulder, \u201cwould you mind taking him into the car? I\u2019ll tell you why after.\u201d He pointed to two woe-begone figures that stood on the side", "of the road. They were of an old man and a girl; Leslie could not see their faces distinctly. They stood with their backs to the storm, one thin coat spread about them both. Gilbert shouted something, and at his voice the old man turned. He had a beautiful face, thin, refined, intellectual; it was the face of an artist. His grey hair straggled over his collar, and under the cloak he clutched something, the care of which seemed to concern him more than his protection from the merciless downpour. The girl at his side might have been seventeen, a solemn child, with great fearless eyes that surveyed the occupants of the car gravely. The old man hesitated at Gilbert\u2019s invitation, but as he beckoned impatiently he brought the girl down to the road and Leslie opened the door. \u201cJump in quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cMy word, you\u2019re wet!\u201d He slammed the door behind them, and they seated themselves facing him. They were in a pitiable condition; the girl\u2019s dress was soaked, her face was wet as though she had come straight from a bath. \u201cTake that cloak off,\u201d said Leslie brusquely. \u201cI\u2019ve a couple of dry handkerchiefs, though I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll want a bath towel.\u201d She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s very kind of you,\u201d she said. \u201cWe shall ruin your car.\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s all right,\u201d said Leslie cheerfully. \u201cIt\u2019s not my car. Anyway,\u201d he added, \u201cwhen Mr. Standerton comes in he will make it much worse.\u201d He was wondering in his mind by what freakish inclination Standerton had called these two people to the refuge of his Limousine. The old man smiled as he spoke, and his first words were an explanation. \u201cMr. Standerton has always been very good to me,\u201d he said gently, almost humbly. He had a soft, well-modulated voice. Leslie Frankfort recognised that it was the voice of an educated man. He smiled. He was too used to meeting Standerton\u2019s friends to be surprised at this storm-soddened street musician, for such he judged him to be by the neck of the violin which protruded from the soaked coat. \u201cYou know him, do you?\u201d The old man nodded. \u201cI know him very well,\u201d he said. He took from under his coat the thing he had been carrying, and Leslie Frankfort saw that it was an old violin. The old man examined it anxiously, then with a sigh of relief he laid it across his knees. \u201cIt\u2019s not damaged, I hope?\u201d asked Leslie. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d said the other; \u201cI was greatly afraid that it was going to be an unfortunate ending to what has been a prosperous day.\u201d They had been playing on the Downs, and had reaped a profitable harvest. \u201cMy grand-daughter also plays,\u201d said the old man. \u201cWe do not as a rule care for these great crowds, but it invariably means money\u201d--he smiled--\u201cand we are not in a position to reject any opportunity which offers.\u201d They were now drawing clear of the storm. They had passed through Sutton,", "and had reached a place where the roads were as yet dry, when Gilbert stopped the car and handed the wheel to the shame-faced chauffeur. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry, sir,\u201d the man began. \u201cOh, don\u2019t bother,\u201d smiled his employer, \u201cone is never to be blamed for funking a storm. I used to be as bad until I got over it\u2026 there are worse things,\u201d he added, half to himself. The man thanked him with a muttered word, and Gilbert opened the door of the car and entered. He nodded to the old man and gave a quick smile to the girl. \u201cI thought I recognised you,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is Mr. Springs,\u201d he said, turning to Leslie. \u201cHe\u2019s quite an old friend of mine. I\u2019m sure when you have dined at St. John\u2019s Wood you must have heard Springs\u2019 violin under the dining-room window. It used to be a standing order, didn\u2019t it, Mr. Springs?\u201d he said. \u201cBy the way,\u201d he asked suddenly, \u201cwere you playing----\u201d He stopped, and the old man, misunderstanding the purport of the question, nodded. \u201cAfter all,\u201d said Gilbert, with a sudden change of manner, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be humane to leave my private band to drown on Epsom Downs, to say nothing of the chance of his being struck by lightning.\u201d \u201cWas there any danger?\u201d asked Leslie in surprise. Gilbert nodded. \u201cI saw one poor chap struck as I cleared the Downs,\u201d he said; \u201cthere were a lot of people near him, so I didn\u2019t trouble to stop. It was a terrifying experience.\u201d He looked back out of the little oval window behind. \u201cWe shall have it again in London to-night,\u201d he said, \u201cbut storms do not feel so dangerous in town as they do in the country. They\u2019re not so alarming. Housetops are very merciful to the nervous.\u201d They took farewell of the old man and his grand-daughter at Balham, and then, as the car continued, Leslie turned with a puzzled look to his companion. \u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful man, Gilbert,\u201d he said; \u201cI can\u2019t understand you. You described yourself only this morning as being a nervous wreck----\u201d \u201cDid I say that?\u201d asked the other dryly. \u201cWell, you didn\u2019t admit it,\u201d said Leslie, with an aggrieved air, \u201cbut it was a description which most obviously fitted you. And yet in the face of this storm, which I confess curled me up pretty considerably, you take the seat of your chauffeur and you push the car through it. Moreover, you are sufficiently collected to pick up an old man, when you had every excuse to leave him to his dismal fate.\u201d For a moment Gilbert made no reply; then he laughed a little bitterly. \u201cThere are a dozen ways of being nervous,\u201d he said, \u201cand that doesn\u2019t happen to be one of mine. The old man is an important factor in my life, though he does not know it--the very instrument of fate.\u201d He dropped his voice almost solemnly. Then he seemed to remember that the curious gaze", "of the other was upon him. \u201cI don\u2019t know where you got the impression that I was a nervous wreck,\u201d he said briefly. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly the ideal condition for a man who is to be married this week.\u201d \u201cThat may be the cause, my dear chap,\u201d said the other reflectively. \u201cI know a lot of people who are monstrously upset at the prospect. There was Tuppy Jones who absolutely ran away--lost his memory, or some such newspaper trick.\u201d Gilbert smiled. \u201cI did the next worst thing to running away,\u201d he said a little moodily. \u201cI wanted the wedding postponed.\u201d \u201cBut why?\u201d demanded the other. \u201cI was going to ask you that this morning coming down, only it slipped my memory. Mrs. Cathcart told me she wouldn\u2019t hear of it.\u201d Gilbert gave him no encouragement to continue the subject, but the voluble young man went on-- \u201cTake what the gods give you, my son,\u201d he said. \u201cHere you are with a Foreign Office appointment, an Under-Secretaryship looming in the near future, a most charming and beautiful bride in prospect, rich----\u201d \u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d said Gilbert sharply. \u201cThe idea is abroad all over London. Beyond my pay I have no money whatever. This car,\u201d he said, as he saw the other\u2019s questioning face, \u201cis certainly mine--at least, it was a present from my uncle, and I don\u2019t suppose he\u2019ll want it returned before I sell it. Thank God it makes no difference to you,\u201d he went on with that note of hardness still in his voice, \u201cbut I am half inclined to think that two-thirds of the friendships I have, and all the kindness which is from time to time shown to me, is based upon that delusion of riches. People think that I am my uncle\u2019s heir.\u201d \u201cBut aren\u2019t you?\u201d gasped the other. Gilbert shook his head. \u201cMy uncle has recently expressed his intention of leaving the whole of his fortune to that admirable institution which is rendering such excellent service to the canine world--the Battersea Dogs\u2019 Home.\u201d Leslie Frankfort\u2019s jovial face bore an expression of tragic bewilderment. \u201cHave you told Mrs. Cathcart this?\u201d he asked. \u201cMrs. Cathcart!\u201d replied the other in surprise. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t told her. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. After all,\u201d he said with a smile, \u201cEdith isn\u2019t marrying me for money, she is pretty rich herself, isn\u2019t she? Not that it matters,\u201d he said hastily, \u201cwhether she\u2019s rich or whether she\u2019s poor.\u201d Neither of the two men spoke again for the rest of the journey, and at the corner of St. James\u2019s Street Gilbert put his friend down. He continued his way to the little house which he had taken furnished a year before, when marriage had only seemed the remotest of possibilities, when his worldly prospects had seemed much brighter than they were at present. Gilbert Standerton was a member of one of those peculiar families which seem to be made up entirely of nephews. His uncle, the eccentric old Anglo-Indian, had", "charged himself with the boy\u2019s future, and he had been mainly responsible for securing the post which Gilbert now held. More than this, he had made him his heir, and since he was a man who did nothing in secret, and was rather inclined to garrulity, the news of Gilbert\u2019s good fortune was spread from one end of England to the other. Then, a month before this story opens, had come like a bombshell a curt notification from his relative that he had deemed it advisable to alter the terms of his will, and that Gilbert might look for no more than the thousand pounds to which, in common with innumerable other nephews, he was entitled. It was not a shock to Gilbert except that he was a little grieved with the fear that in some manner he had offended his fiery uncle. He had a too lively appreciation of the old man\u2019s goodness to him to resent the eccentricity which would make him a comparatively poor man. It would have considerably altered the course of his life if he had notified at least one person of the change in his prospects. CHAPTER III. GILBERT LEAVES HURRIEDLY Gilbert was dressing for dinner when the storm came up over London. It had lost none of its intensity or strength. For an hour the street had glared fitfully in the blue lightning of the electrical discharges, and the house rocked with crash after crash of thunder. He himself was in tune with the element, for there raged in his heart such a storm as shook the very foundations of his life. Outwardly there was no sign of distress. The face he saw in the shaving-glass was a mask, immobile and expressionless. He sent his man to call a taxi-cab. The storm had passed over London, and only the low grumble of thunder could be heard when he came out on to the rain-washed streets. A few wind-torn wisps of cloud were hurrying at a great rate across the sky, stragglers endeavouring in frantic haste to catch up the main body. He descended from his cab at the door of No. 274 Portland Square slowly and reluctantly. He had an unpleasant task to perform, as unpleasant to him, more unpleasant, indeed, than it could be to his future mother-in-law. He did not doubt that the suspicion implanted in his mind by Leslie was unfair and unworthy. He was ushered into the drawing-room, and found himself the solitary occupant. He looked at his watch. \u201cAm I very early, Cole?\u201d he asked the butler. \u201cYou are rather, sir,\u201d said the man, \u201cbut I will tell Miss Cathcart you are here.\u201d Gilbert nodded. He strolled across to the window, and stood, his hands clasped behind him, looking out upon the wet street. He stood thus for five minutes, his head sunk forward on his breast, absorbed in thought. The opening of the door aroused him, and he turned to meet the girl who had entered. Edith", "Cathcart was one of the most beautiful women in London, though \u201cwoman\u201d might be too serious a word to apply to this slender girl who had barely emerged from her school-days. In some grey eyes of a peculiar softness a furtive apprehension always seems to wait--a fear and an appeal at one and the same time. So it was with Edith Cathcart. Those eyes of hers were for ever on guard, and even as they attracted they held the overeager seeker of friendship at arm\u2019s length. The nose was just a little retrouss\u00e8; the sensitive lips played supporter to the apprehensive eyes. She wore her hair low over her forehead; it was dark almost to a point of blackness. She was dressed in a plain gown of sea-green satin, with scarcely any jewel or ornamentation. He walked to meet her with quick steps and took both her hands in his; his hungry eyes searched her face eagerly. \u201cYou look lovely to-night, Edith,\u201d he said, in a voice scarcely above a whisper. She released her hands gently with the ghost of a smile that subtly atoned for her action. \u201cDid you enjoy your Derby Day?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt was enormously interesting,\u201d he said; \u201cit is extraordinary that I have never been before.\u201d \u201cYou could not have chosen a worse day. Did you get caught in the storm? We have had a terrible one here.\u201d She spoke quickly, with a little note of query at the end of each sentence. She gave you the impression that she desired to stand well with her lover, that she was in some awe of him. She was like a child, anxious to acquit herself well of a lesson; and now and then she conveyed a sense of relief, as one who had surmounted yet another obstacle. Gilbert was always conscious of the strain which marked their relationship. A dozen times a day he told himself that it was incredible that such a strain should exist. But he found a ready excuse for her diffidence and the furtive fear which came and went in her eyes like shadows over the sea. She was young, much younger than her years. This beautiful bud had not opened yet, and his engagement had been cursed by over-much formality. He had met her conventionally at a ball. He had been introduced by her mother, again conventionally, he had danced with her and sat out with her, punted her on the river, motored her and her mother to Ascot. It was all very ordinary and commonplace. It lacked something. Gilbert never had any doubt as to that. He took the blame upon himself for all deficiencies, though he was something of a romancist, despite the chilly formalism of the engagement. She had kept him in his place with the rest of the world, one arm\u2019s length, with those beseeching eyes of hers. He was at arm\u2019s length when he proposed, in a speech the fluency of which was eloquent of the", "absence of anything which touched emotionalism. And she had accepted in a murmured word, and turned a cold cheek for his kiss, and then had fluttered out of his arms like an imprisoned bird seeking its liberty, and had escaped from that conventional conservatory with its horrible palms and its spurious Tanagra statuettes. Gilbert in love was something of a boy; an idealist, a dreamer. Other grown men have shared his weakness, there are unsuspected wells of romance in the most practical of men. So he was content with his dreams, weaving this and that story of sweet surrender in his inmost heart. He loved her, completely, absorbingly. To him she was a divine and a fragrant thing. He had taken her hand again in his, and realised with pain, which was tinctured with amusement that made it bearable, that she was seeking to disengage herself, when Mrs. Cathcart came into the room. She was a tall woman, still beautiful, though age had given her a certain angularity. The ravages of time had made it necessary for her to seek artificial aid for the strengthening of her attractions. Her mouth was thin and straight and uncompromising, her chin too bony to be beautiful. She smiled as she rustled across the room and offered her gloved hand to the young man. \u201cYou\u2019re early, Gilbert,\u201d she said. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied awkwardly. Here was the opportunity which he sought, yet he experienced some reluctance in availing himself of the chance. He had released the girl as the door opened, and she had instinctively taken a step backward, and stood with her hands behind her, regarding him gravely and intently. \u201cReally,\u201d he said, \u201cI wanted to see you.\u201d \u201cTo see me?\u201d asked Mrs. Cathcart archly. \u201cNo, surely not me!\u201d Her smile comprehended the girl and the young man. For some reason which he could not appreciate at the moment Gilbert felt uncomfortable. \u201cYes, it was to see you,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it isn\u2019t remarkable at this particular period of time.\u201d He smiled again. She held up a warning finger. \u201cYou must not bother about any of the arrangements. I want you to leave that entirely to me. You will find you have no cause to complain.\u201d \u201cOh, it wasn\u2019t that,\u201d he said hastily, \u201cit was something more--more--\u201d He hesitated. He wanted to convey to her the gravity of the business he had in hand. And even as he approached the question of an interview, a dim realisation came to him of the difficulty of his position. How could he suggest to this woman, who had been all kindness and all sweetness to him, that he suspected her of motives which did credit neither to her head nor her heart? How could he broach the subject of his poverty to one who had not once but a hundred times confided to him that his expectations and the question of his future wealth were the only drawbacks to what she had described as an ideal love", "marriage? \u201cI almost wish you were poor, Gilbert,\u201d she had said. \u201cI think riches are an awful handicap to young people circumstanced as you and Edith will be.\u201d She had conveyed this suspicion of his wealth more than once. And yet, at a chance word from Leslie, he had doubted the purity of her motives! He remembered with a growing irritation that it had been Mrs. Cathcart who had made the marriage possible; the vulgar-minded might even have gone further, and suggested that she had thrown Edith at his head. There was plenty of groundwork for Leslie\u2019s suspicion, he thought, as he looked at the tall, stylish woman before him. Only he felt ashamed that he had listened to the insidious suggestion. \u201cCould you give me a quarter of an hour----\u201d He stopped. He was going to say \u201cbefore dinner,\u201d but thought that possibly an interview after the meal would be less liable to interruption. \u201c--after dinner?\u201d \u201cWith pleasure,\u201d she smiled. \u201cWhat are you going to do? Confess some of the irregularities of your youth?\u201d He shook his head with a little grimace. \u201cYou may be sure I shall never tell you those,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I will see you after dinner,\u201d she assented. \u201cThere are a lot of people coming to-night, and I am simply up to my eyes in work. You bridegrooms,\u201d she patted his shoulder with her fan reproachfully, \u201chave no idea what chaos you bring into the domestic life of your unfortunate relatives of the future.\u201d Edith stood aloof, in the attitude she had adopted when he had released her, watchful, curious, in the scene, but not of it. It was an effect which the presence of Mrs. Cathcart invariably produced upon her daughter. It was not an obliteration, not exactly an eclipse, as the puzzled Gilbert had often observed. It was as though the entrance of one character of a drama were followed by the immediate exit of her who had previously occupied the scene. He pictured Edith waiting at the wings for a cue which would bring her into active existence again, and that cue was invariably the retirement of her mother. \u201cThere are quite a number of nice people coming to-night, Gilbert,\u201d said Mrs. Cathcart, glancing at a slip of paper in her hand. \u201cThere are some you don\u2019t know, and some I want you very much to meet. I am sure you will like dear Dr. Cassylis----\u201d A smothered exclamation caught her ear, and she looked up sharply. Gilbert\u2019s face was set: it was void of all expression. The girl saw the mask and wondered. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Mrs. Cathcart. \u201cNothing,\u201d said Gilbert steadily, \u201cyou were talking about your guests.\u201d \u201cI was saying that you must meet Dr. Barclay-Seymour--he is a most charming man. I don\u2019t think you know him?\u201d Gilbert shook his head. \u201cWell, you ought to,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a dear friend of mine, and why on earth he practises in Leeds instead of maintaining an establishment in Harley", "Street I haven\u2019t the slightest idea. The ways of men are beyond finding out. Then there is.\u2026\u201d She reeled off a list of names, some of which Gilbert knew. \u201cWhat is the time?\u201d she asked suddenly. Gilbert looked at his watch. \u201cA quarter to eight? I must go,\u201d she said. \u201cI will see you immediately after dinner.\u201d She turned back as she reached the door irresolutely. \u201cI suppose you aren\u2019t going to change that absurd plan of yours,\u201d she asked hopefully. Gilbert had recovered his equanimity. \u201cI do not know to which absurd plan you are referring,\u201d he said. \u201cSpending your honeymoon in town,\u201d she replied. \u201cI don\u2019t think Gilbert should be bothered about that.\u201d It was the girl who spoke, her first intrusion into the conversation. Her mother glanced at her sharply. \u201cIn this case, my dear,\u201d she said freezingly, \u201cit is a matter in which I am more concerned than yourself.\u201d Gilbert hastened to relieve the girl of the brunt of the storm. Mrs. Cathcart was not slow to anger, and although Gilbert himself had never felt the lash of her bitter tongue, he had a shrewd suspicion that his future wife had been a victim more than once. \u201cIt is absolutely necessary that I should be in town on the days I referred to,\u201d he said. \u201cI have asked you----\u201d \u201cTo postpone the wedding?\u201d said Mrs. Cathcart. \u201cMy dear boy, I couldn\u2019t do that. It wasn\u2019t a reasonable request, now was it?\u201d She smiled at him as sweetly as her inward annoyance allowed her. \u201cI suppose it wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said dubiously. He said no more, but waited until the door had closed behind her, then he turned quickly to the girl. \u201cEdith,\u201d he said, speaking rapidly, \u201cI want you to do something for me.\u201d \u201cYou want me to do something?\u201d she asked in surprise. \u201cYes, dearest. I must go away now. I want you to find some excuse to make to your mother. I\u2019ve remembered a most important matter which I have not seen to----\u201d He spoke hesitatingly, for he was no ready liar. \u201cGoing away!\u201d It was surprise rather than disappointment, he noticed, and was pardonably irritated. \u201cYou can\u2019t go now,\u201d she said, and that look of fear came into her eyes. \u201cMother would be so angry. The people are arriving.\u201d From where he stood he had seen three motor broughams draw up almost simultaneously in front of the house. \u201cI must go,\u201d he said desperately. \u201cCan\u2019t you get me out in any way? I don\u2019t want to meet these people, I\u2019ve very good reasons.\u201d She hesitated a moment. \u201cWhere are your hat and coat?\u201d she asked. \u201cIn the hall--you will just have time,\u201d he said. She was in the hall and back again with his coat, led him to the farther end of the drawing-room, through a door which communicated with the small library beyond. There was a way here to the garage and to the mews at the back of the house. She watched", "the tall, striding figure with a troubled gaze, then as he disappeared from view she fastened the library door and came back to the drawing-room in time to meet her mother. \u201cWhere is Gilbert?\u201d asked Mrs. Cathcart. \u201cGone,\u201d said the girl. \u201cGone!\u201d Edith nodded slowly. \u201cHe remembered something very important and had to go back to his house.\u201d \u201cBut of course he is returning?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think so, mother,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI fancy that the \u2018something\u2019 is immensely pressing.\u201d \u201cBut this is nonsense!\u201d Mrs. Cathcart stamped her foot. \u201cHere are all the people whom I have specially invited to meet him. It\u2019s disgraceful!\u201d \u201cBut, mother----\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t \u2018but mother\u2019 me, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d said Mrs. Cathcart. They were alone, the guests were assembling in the larger drawing-room, and there was no need for the elder woman to disguise her feelings. \u201cYou sent him away, I suppose?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t blame him. How can you expect to keep a man at your side if you treat him as though he were a grocer calling for orders?\u201d The girl listened wearily, and did not raise her eyes from the carpet. \u201cI do my best,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cYour worst must be pretty bad if that is your best. After I\u2019ve strained my every effort to bring to you one of the richest young men in London, you might at least pretend that his presence is welcome; but if he were the devil himself you couldn\u2019t show greater reluctance at meeting him or greater relief at his departure.\u201d \u201cMother!\u201d said the girl, and her eyes were filled with tears. \u201cDon\u2019t \u2018mother\u2019 me, please!\u201d said Mrs. Cathcart deliberately. \u201cI am sick to death of your faddiness and your prejudices. What on earth do you want? What am I to get you?\u201d She threw out her arms in exasperated despair. \u201cI don\u2019t want to marry at all,\u201d said the girl in a low voice. \u201cMy father would never have forced me to marry.\u201d It was a daring thing to say, an exhibition of greater boldness than she had ever shown before in her encounters with her mother. But lately there had come to her a new courage. That despair which had made her dumb glowed now to rage, the fires of rebellion smouldered in her heart; and, albeit the demonstrations of her growing resentment were few and far between, her courage grew upon her venturing. \u201cYour father!\u201d breathed Mrs. Cathcart, white with rage, \u201cam I to have your father thrown at my head? Your father was a fool! A fool!\u201d She almost hissed the word. \u201cHe ruined me as he ruined you because he hadn\u2019t sufficient sense to keep the money he had inherited. I thought he was a clever man. I looked up to him for twenty years as the embodiment of all that was wise and kind and genial, and all those twenty years he was frittering away his competence on every hair-brained scheme which the needy adventurers of", "finance brought to him. He would not have forced you! I swear he wouldn\u2019t!\u201d She laughed bitterly. \u201cHe would have married you to the chauffeur if your heart was that way inclined. He was all amiability and incompetence, all good-nature and inefficiency. I hate your father!\u201d Her blue eyes were opened to their widest extent and the cold glare of hate was indeed apparent to the shrinking girl. \u201cI hate him every time I have to entertain a shady stockbroker for the advantage I may receive from his knowledge of the market; I hate him for every economy I have to practise; I hate him every time I see my meagre dividends come in and as I watch them swallowed up by the results of his folly. Don\u2019t make me hate you,\u201d she said, pointing a warning finger at the girl. Edith had cowered before the torrent of words, but this slander of her dead father roused something within her, put aside all fear of consequence, even though that consequence might be a further demonstration of that anger which she so dreaded. Now she stood erect, facing the woman she called mother, her face pale, but her chin tilted a little defiantly. \u201cYou may say what you like about me, mother,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cbut I will not have you defame my father. I have done all you requested: I am going to marry a man who, though I know he is a kindly and charming man, is no more to me than the first individual I might meet in the street to-night. I am making this sacrifice for your sake: do not ask me to forego my faith in the man who is the one lovable memory in my life.\u201d Her voice broke a little, her eyes were bright with tears. Whatever Mrs. Cathcart might have said, and there were many things she could have said, was checked by the entry of a servant. For a moment or two they stood facing one another, mother and daughter, in silence. Then without another word Mrs. Cathcart turned on her heel and walked out of the room. The girl waited for a moment, then went back to the library through which Gilbert had passed. She closed the door behind her and turned on one of the lights, for it was growing dark. She was shaking from head to foot with the play of these pent emotions of hers. She could have wept, but with anger and shame. For the first time in her life her mother had shown her heart. The concentrated bitterness of years had poured forth, unchecked by pity or policy. She had revealed the hate which for all these years had been gnawing at her soul; revealed in a flash the relationship between her father and her mother which the girl had never suspected. That they had not been on the most affectionate terms Edith knew, but her short association with the world in which they moved had", "reconciled her mind to the coolness which characterised the attitudes of husband and wife. She had seen a score of such houses where man and wife were on little more than friendly terms, and had accepted such conditions as normal. It aroused in her a wild irritation that such relationships should exist: child as she was, she had felt that something was missing. But it had also reconciled her to her marriage with Gilbert Standerton. Her life with him would be no worse, and probably might be a little better, than the married lives of those people with whom she was brought into daily contact. But in her mother\u2019s vehemence she caught a glimpse of the missing quality of marriage. She knew now why her gentle father had changed suddenly from a genial, kindly man, with his quick laugh and his too willing ear for the plausible, into a silent shadow of a man, the sad, broken figure she so vividly retained in her memory. Here was a quick turn in the road of life for her an unexpected vista flashing into view suddenly before her eyes. It calmed her, steadied her. In those few minutes of reflection, standing there in the commonplace, gloomy little library, watching through the latticed panes the dismal mews which offered itself for inspection through a parallelogram of bricked courtyard, she experienced one of those great and subtle changes which come to humanity. There was a new outlook, a new standard by which to measure her fellows, a new philosophy evolved in the space of a second. It was a tremendous upheaval of settled conviction which this tiny apartment witnessed. She was surprised herself at the calmness with which she returned to the drawing-room and joined the party now beginning to assemble. It came as a shock to discover that she was examining her mother with the calm, impartial scrutiny of one who was not in any way associated with her. Mrs. Cathcart observed the girl\u2019s self-possession and felt a twinge of uneasiness. She addressed her unexpectedly, hoping to surprise her to embarrassment, and was a little staggered by the readiness with which the girl met her gaze and the coolness with which she disagreed to some proposition which the elder woman had made. It was a new experience to the masterful Mrs. Cathcart. The girl might be sulking, but this was a new variety of sulks, foreign to Mrs. Cathcart\u2019s experience. She might be angry, yet there was no sign of anger; hurt--she should have been in tears. Mrs. Cathcart\u2019s experienced eye could detect no sign of weeping. She was puzzled, a little alarmed. She had gone too far, she thought, and must conciliate, rather than carry on the feud until the other sued for forgiveness. It irritated her to find herself in this position, but she was a tactician first and foremost, and it would be bad tactics on her part to pursue a disadvantage. Rather she sought the status quo ante bellum,", "and was annoyed to discover that it had gone for ever. She hoped the talk that evening would confuse the girl to the point of seeking her protection; but to her astonishment Edith spoke of her marriage as she had never spoken of it before, without embarrassment, without hesitation, coolly, reasonably, intelligently. The end of the evening found Edith commanding her field and her mother in the position of a suitor. Mrs. Cathcart waited till the last guest had gone, then she came into the smaller drawing-room to find Edith standing in the fireplace, looking thoughtfully at a paper which lay upon the mantleshelf. \u201cWhat is it interests you so much, dear?\u201d The girl looked round, picked up the paper and folded it slowly. \u201cNothing particularly,\u201d she said. \u201cYour Dr. Cassylis is an amusing man.\u201d \u201cHe is a very clever man,\u201d said her mother tartly. She had infinite faith in doctors, and offered them the tribute which is usually reserved for the supernatural. \u201cIs he?\u201d said the girl coolly. \u201cI suppose he is. Why does he live in Leeds?\u201d \u201cReally, Edith, you are coming out of your shell,\u201d said her mother with a forced smile of admiration. \u201cI have never known you take so much interest in the people of the world before.\u201d \u201cI am going to take a great deal of interest in people,\u201d said the girl steadily. \u201cI have been missing so much all my life.\u201d \u201cI think you are being a little horrid,\u201d said her mother, repressing her anger with an effort; \u201cyou\u2019re certainly being very unkind. I suppose all this nonsense has arisen out of my mistaken confidence.\u201d The girl made no reply. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go to bed, mother,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd whilst you\u2019re engaged in settling your estimate of people,\u201d said Mrs. Cathcart with ominous calm, \u201cperhaps you will interpret your fianc\u00e9\u2019s behaviour to me. Dr. Cassylis particularly wanted to meet him.\u201d \u201cI am not going to interpret anything,\u201d said the girl. \u201cDon\u2019t employ that tone with me,\u201d replied her mother sharply. The girl stopped, she was half-way to the door. She hardly turned, but spoke to her mother over her shoulder. \u201cMother,\u201d she said, quietly but decidedly, \u201cI want you to understand this: if there is any more bother, or if I am again made the victim of your crossness, I shall write to Gilbert and break off my engagement.\u201d \u201cAre you mad?\u201d gasped the woman. Edith shook her head. \u201cNo, I am tired,\u201d she said, \u201ctired of many things.\u201d There was much that Mrs. Cathcart could have said, but with a belated wisdom she held her tongue till the door had closed behind her daughter. Then, late as the hour was, she sent for the cook and settled herself grimly for a pleasing half hour, for the vol-au-vent had been atrocious. CHAPTER IV. THE \u201cMELODY IN F\u201d Gilbert Standerton was dressing slowly before his glass when Leslie was announced. That individual was radiant and beautiful to behold as became the best man", "at the wedding of an old friend. Leslie Frankfort was one of those fortunate individuals who combine congenial work with the enjoyment of a private income. He was the junior partner of a firm of big stockbrokers in the City, a firm which dealt only with the gilt-edged markets of finance. He enjoyed in common with Gilbert a taste for classical music, and this was the bond which had first drawn the two men together. He came into the room, deposited his silk hat carefully upon a chair, and sat on the edge of the bed, offering critical suggestions to the prospective bridegroom. \u201cBy the way,\u201d he said suddenly, \u201cI saw that old man of yours yesterday.\u201d Gilbert looked round. \u201cYou mean Springs, the musician?\u201d The other nodded. \u201cHe was playing for the amusement of a theatre queue--a fine old chap.\u201d \u201cVery,\u201d said Gilbert absently. He paused in his dressing, took up a letter from the table, and handed it to the other. \u201cAm I to read it?\u201d asked Leslie. Gilbert nodded. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to read, as a matter of fact,\u201d he said; \u201cit\u2019s my uncle\u2019s wedding present.\u201d The young man opened the envelope and extracted the pink slip. He looked at the amount and whistled. \u201cOne hundred pounds,\u201d he said. \u201cGood Lord! that won\u2019t pay the up-keep of your car for a quarter. I suppose you told Mrs. Cathcart?\u201d Gilbert shook his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he said shortly, \u201cI intended telling her but I haven\u2019t. I am perfectly satisfied in my own mind, Leslie, that we are doing her an injustice. She has been so emphatic about money. And after all, I\u2019m not a pauper,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re worse than a pauper,\u201d said Leslie earnestly; \u201ca man with six hundred a year is the worst kind of pauper I know.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll never bring your tastes below a couple of thousand, you\u2019ll never raise your income above six hundred-- plus your Foreign Office job, that\u2019s only another six hundred.\u201d \u201cWork,\u201d said the other. \u201cWork!\u201d said the other scornfully, \u201cyou don\u2019t earn money by work. You earn money by scheming, by getting the better of the other fellow. You\u2019re too soft-hearted to make money, my son.\u201d \u201cYou seem to make money,\u201d said Gilbert with a little smile. Leslie shook his head vigorously. \u201cI\u2019ve never made a penny in my life,\u201d he confessed with some enjoyment. \u201cNo, I have got some very stout, unimaginative senior partners who do all the money-making. I merely take dividends at various periods of the year. But then I was in luck. What is your money, by the way?\u201d Gilbert was in the act of tying his cravat. He looked up with a little frown. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked. \u201cI mean, is it in securities --does it continue after your death?\u201d The little frown still knit the brows of the other. \u201cNo,\u201d he said shortly, \u201cafter my death there is scarcely enough to bring in a hundred and fifty a year. I", "am only enjoying a life interest on this particular property.\u201d Leslie whistled. \u201cWell, I hope, old son, that you\u2019re well insured.\u201d The other man made no attempt to interrupt as Leslie, arguing with great fluency and skill on the duties and responsibilities of heads of families, delivered himself of his views on insurance and upon the uninsured. \u201cSome Johnnies are so improvident,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew a man----\u201d He stopped suddenly. He had caught a reflection of Gilbert\u2019s face in the glass. It was haggard and drawn, it seemed the face of a man in mortal agony. Leslie sprang up. \u201cWhat on earth is the matter, my dear chap?\u201d he cried. He came to the other\u2019s side and laid his hand on his shoulder. \u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing--nothing, Leslie,\u201d said Gilbert. He passed his hand before his eyes as though to wipe away some ugly vision. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve been rather a careless devil. You see, I depended too much upon uncle\u2019s money. I ought to be insured.\u201d \u201cThat isn\u2019t worrying you surely?\u201d asked the other in astonishment. \u201cIt worries me a bit,\u201d said Gilbert moodily. \u201cOne never knows, you know----\u201d He stood looking thoughtfully at the other, his hands thrust into his pockets. \u201cI wish to heaven this wedding had been postponed!\u201d Leslie laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s about time you were married,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat a jumpy ass you are.\u201d He looked at his watch. \u201cYou\u2019d better hurry up, or you\u2019ll be losing this bride of yours. After all, this isn\u2019t a day for gloom, it\u2019s the day of days, my friend.\u201d He saw the soft look that came into Gilbert\u2019s eyes, and felt satisfied with his work. \u201cYes, there is that,\u201d said Gilbert Standerton softly. \u201cI forgot all my blessings. God bless her!\u201d he said under his breath. As they were leaving the house, Gilbert asked-- \u201cI suppose you have a list of the guests who are to be present?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said the other, \u201cMrs. Cathcart was most duteous.\u201d \u201cWill Dr. Barclay-Seymour be there?\u201d asked the other carelessly. \u201cBarclay-Seymour--no, he won\u2019t be there,\u201d replied Leslie, \u201che\u2019s the Leeds Johnnie, isn\u2019t he? He went up from London last night. What\u2019s this talk of your having run away the other night?\u201d \u201cIt was an important engagement,\u201d said Gilbert hurriedly, \u201cI had a man to see; I couldn\u2019t very well put him off----\u201d Leslie realised that he had asked an embarrassing question and changed the subject. \u201cBy the way,\u201d he said, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t mention this matter of the money to Mrs. Cathcart till after you\u2019ve both settled down.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d said Gilbert grimly. On the way to the church he reviewed all the troubles that were besetting him and faced them squarely. Perhaps it would not be as bad as he thought. He was ever prone to take an exaggerated and a worrying view of troubles. He had anticipated dangers, and time and time again his fears had been groundless. He had lived too long alone. A man ought to be married before he", "was thirty-two. That was his age. He had become cranky. He found consolation in uncomplimentary analysis till the church was reached. It was a dream, that ceremony: the crowded pews, the organ, the white-robed choir, the rector and his assistants; the coming of Edith, so beautiful, so ethereal in her bridal robes; the responses, the kneeling and the rising--it was all unreal. He had thought that the music would have made a lasting impression on him; he had been at some pains to choose it, and had had several consultations with the organist. But at the end of the service when he began to walk, still in his dream, towards the vestry, he could not recall one single bar. He had a dim recollection of the fact that above the altar was a stained glass window, one tiny pane of which had been removed, evidently on account of a breakage. He was back in the house, sitting at the be-flowered table, listening in some confusion to the speeches and the bursts of laughter which assailed each speaker as he made his point: now he was on his feet, talking easily, without effort, but what words he used, or why people applauded, or why they smiled he could not say. Once in its course he had looked down at the delicate face by his side, and had met those solemn eyes of hers, less fearful to-day, it seemed, than ever he had seen them. He had felt for her hand and had held it, cold and unresponsive, in his.\u2026 \u201cAn excellent speech,\u201d said Leslie. They were in the drawing-room after the breakfast. \u201cYou\u2019re quite an orator.\u201d \u201cAm I?\u201d said Gilbert. He was beginning to wake again. The drawing-room was real, these people were real, the jokes, the badinage, and the wit which flew from tongue to tongue--all these things were of a life he knew. \u201cWhew!\u201d He wiped his forehead and breathed a deep sigh. He felt like a man who had regained consciousness after an an\u00e6sthetic that did not quite take effect. A painless and a beautiful experience, but of another world, and it was not he, so he told himself, who had knelt at the altar rail. * * * * Officially the honeymoon was to be spent at Harrogate, actually it was to be spent in London. They preserved the pretence of catching a train, and drove to King\u2019s Cross. No word was spoken throughout that journey. Gilbert felt the restriction, and did not challenge it or seek to overcome it. The girl was naturally silent. She had so much to say in the proper place and at the proper time. He saw the old fear come back to her eyes, was hurt by the unconscious and involuntary shrinking when his hand touched hers. The carriage was dismissed at King\u2019s Cross. A taxi- cab was engaged, and they drove to the house in St. John\u2019s Wood. It was empty, the servants had been sent away on a holiday,", "but it was a perfectly fitted little mansion. There were electric cookers, and every labour-saving appliance the mind of man could devise, or a young man with great expectations and no particular idea of the value of money could acquire. This was to be one of the joys of the honeymoon, so Gilbert had told himself. She had willingly dispensed with her maid; he was ready to be man-of-all-work, to cook and to serve, leaving the rough work for the two new day servants he had employed to come in in the morning. Yet it was with no sense of joyfulness that he led her from room to room, showed her the treasures of his household. A sense of apprehension of some coming trouble laid its hand upon his tongue, damped his spirit, and held him in temporary bondage. The girl was self-possessed. She admired, criticised kindly, and rallied him gently upon his domesticity. But the strain was there all the time; there was a shadow which lay between them. She went to her room to change. They had arranged to go out to dinner, and this programme they followed. Leslie Frankfort saw them in the dining hall of Princes, and pretended he didn\u2019t know them. It was ten o\u2019clock when they went back to their little house. Gilbert went to his study; his wife had gone up to her room and had promised to come down for coffee. He went to work with all the skill which a pupil of Rahbat might be expected to display, and brewed two tiny little cups of Mocha. This he served on the table near the settee where she would sit\u2026 Then she came in. He had been fast awakening from the dream of the morning. He was alive now. The dazement of that momentous ceremony had worn away. He rose and went a little way towards her. He would have taken her in his arms then and there, but this time the arm\u2019s length was a reality. Her hand touched his breast, and the arm stiffened. He felt the rebuff in the act, and it seemed to him that his heart went cold, and that all the vague terrors of the previous days crystallised into one concrete and terrible truth. He knew all that she had to say before she spoke. It was some time before she found the words she wanted, the opening was so difficult. \u201cGilbert,\u201d she said at last, \u201cI am going to do a cowardly thing. It is only cowardly because I have not told you before.\u201d He motioned her to the settee. He had woven a little romance for this moment, a dream scene which was never to be enacted. Here was the shattering. \u201cI won\u2019t sit down,\u201d she said, \u201cI want all my strength to tell you what I have to tell you. If I hadn\u2019t been an arrant coward I should have told you last night. I meant to tell you,\u201d she said, \u201cbut you", "did not come.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI know,\u201d he said, almost impatiently. \u201cI could not come. I did not wish--I could not come,\u201d he repeated. \u201cYou know what I have to tell you?\u201d Her eyes were steadily fixed on his. \u201cGilbert, I do not love you.\u201d He nodded again. \u201cI know now,\u201d he said. \u201cI never have loved you,\u201d she said in tones of despair; \u201cthere never was any time when I regarded you as more than a dear friend. But----\u201d She wanted to tell him why, but a sense of loyalty to her mother kept her silent. She would take all the blame, for was she not blameworthy? For she, at least, was mistress of her own soul: had she wished, she could have taken a line of greater resistance than that which she had followed. \u201cI married you,\u201d she went on slowly, \u201cbecause--because you are--rich-- because you will be rich.\u201d Her voice dropped at the last word until it was husky. There was a hard fight going on within her. She wanted to tell the truth, and yet she did not want him to think so badly of her as that. \u201cFor my money!\u201d he repeated wonderingly. \u201cYes, I--I wanted to marry a man with money. We have had--a very hard time.\u201d The confession came in little gasps; she had to frame every sentence before she spoke. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t blame mother, I was equally guilty; and I ought to have told you--I wanted to tell you.\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d he said calmly. It is wonderful what reserves of strength come at a man\u2019s bidding. In this terrible crisis, in this moment when the whole of his life\u2019s happiness was shattered, when the fabric of his dream was crumbling like a house of paper, he could be judicial, almost phlegmatic. He saw her sway, and springing to her side caught her. \u201cSit down,\u201d he said quietly. She obeyed without protest. He settled her in the corner of the settee, pushed a cushion almost viciously behind her, and walked back to the fireplace. \u201cSo you married me for my money,\u201d he said, and laughed. It was not without its amusing side, this situation. \u201cBy Heaven, what a comedy--what a comedy!\u201d He laughed again. \u201cMy poor child,\u201d he said, with unaccustomed irony, \u201cI am sorry for you, for you have secured neither husband nor money!\u201d She looked up at him quickly. \u201cNor money,\u201d she repeated. There was only interest that he saw in her eyes. There was no hint of disappointment. He knew the truth, more than she had told him: it was not she who desired a fortune, it was this mother of hers, this domineering, worldly woman. \u201cNo husband and no money,\u201d he repeated savagely, in spite of the almost yearning desire which was in him to spare her. \u201cAnd worse than that\u201d--with two rapid strides he was at the desk which separated them, and bent across it, leaning heavily--\u201cnot only have you no husband, and not only is there no", "money, but----\u201d He stopped as if he had been shot. The girl, looking at him, saw his face go drawn and grey, saw the eyes staring wildly past her, the mouth open in tragic dismay. She got up quickly. \u201cWhat is it? What is it?\u201d she whispered in alarm. \u201cMy God!\u201d His voice was cracked; it was the voice of a man in terror. She half bent her head, listening. From somewhere beneath the window arose the soft, melancholy strains of a violin. The music rose and fell, sobbing and pulsating with passion beneath the magic of the player\u2019s fingers. She stepped to a window and looked out. On the edge of the pavement a girl was playing, a girl whose poverty of dress did not hide her singular beauty. The light from the street lamp fell upon her pale face, her eyes were fixed on the window where Gilbert was standing. Edith looked at her husband. He was shaking like a man with fever. \u201cThe \u2018Melody in F,\u2019\u201d he whispered. \u201cMy God! The \u2018Melody in F\u2019--and on my wedding day!\u201d CHAPTER V. THE MAN WHO DESIRED WEALTH Leslie Frankfort was one of a group of three who stood in the inner office of Messrs. Warrell & Bird before a huge safe. There was plenty to attract and hold their attention, for the floor was littered with tools of every shape and description. The safe itself bore evidence of a determined assault. A semi-circle of holes had been burnt in its solid iron door about the lock. \u201cThey did that with an oxyhydrogen blow-pipe,\u201d said one of the men. He indicated a number of iron tubes which lay upon the ground with the rest of the paraphernalia. \u201cThey made a thorough job of it. I wonder what disturbed them.\u201d The eldest of the men shook his head. \u201cI expect the night watchman may have alarmed them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you think, Frankfort?\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t got over my admiration for their thoroughness yet,\u201d said Leslie. \u201cWhy, the beggars must have used about a couple of hundred pounds\u2019 worth of tools.\u201d He pointed to the kit on the ground. The detective\u2019s gaze followed his extended finger. He smiled. \u201cYes,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cthese people are pretty thorough. You say you\u2019ve lost nothing?\u201d Mr. Warrell shook his head. \u201cYes and no,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cThere was a diamond necklace which was deposited there last week by a client of ours--that has gone. I am anxious for the moment that this loss should not be reported.\u201d The detective looked at him wonderingly. \u201cThat is rather a curious request,\u201d he said, with a smile; \u201cand you don\u2019t usually have diamond necklaces in a stockbroker\u2019s office--if I may be allowed to make that critical remark.\u201d Mr. Warrell smiled. \u201cIt isn\u2019t usual,\u201d he said, \u201cbut a client of ours who went abroad last week came in just twenty minutes before the train left, and asked us to take care of the jewel cases.\u201d Mr. Warrell said", "this carelessly. He did not explain to the detective that they were held as security against the very large difference which the client had incurred; nor did he think it necessary to explain that he had kept the jewels in the office in the hope that the embarrassed lady might be able to redeem them. \u201cDid anybody know they were there except yourself and your partners?\u201d Warrell shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I have never mentioned it to anybody. Have you, Leslie?\u201d Leslie hesitated. \u201cWell, I\u2019m bound to admit that I did,\u201d he confessed, \u201cthough it was to somebody who would not repeat it.\u201d \u201cWho was it?\u201d asked Warrell. \u201cTo Gilbert Standerton. I certainly mentioned the matter when we were discussing safe robberies.\u201d The elder man nodded. \u201cI hardly think he is the sort of person who is likely to burgle a safe.\u201d He smiled. \u201cIt is a very curious coincidence,\u201d said Leslie reflectively, \u201cthat he and I were talking about this very gang only a couple of days ago before he was married. I suppose,\u201d he asked the detective suddenly, \u201cthere is no doubt that this is the work of your international friend?\u201d Chief Inspector Goldberg nodded his head. \u201cNo doubt whatever, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is only one gang in England which could do this, and I could lay my hands on them to-day, but it would be a million pounds to one against my being able to secure at the same time evidence to convict them.\u201d Leslie nodded brightly. \u201cThat is what I was telling Gilbert,\u201d he said, turning to his partner. \u201cIsn\u2019t it extraordinary that these things can be in the twentieth century? Here we have three or four men who are known--you told me their names, Inspector, after the last attempt--and yet the police are powerless to bring home their guilt to them. It does seem curious, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Inspector Goldberg was not amused, but he permitted himself to smile politely. \u201cBut then you\u2019ve got to remember how difficult it is to collect evidence against men who work on such a huge scale as do these bank smashers. What I can\u2019t understand,\u201d he said, \u201cis what attraction your safe has for them. This second attempt is a much more formidable one than the last.\u201d \u201cYes, this is really a burglary,\u201d said Mr. Warrell. \u201cIn the last case there was nothing so elaborate in their preparations, though they were much more successful, in so far as they were able to open the safe.\u201d \u201cI suppose you don\u2019t want more of this to get in the papers than you can help,\u201d said the Inspector. Mr. Warrell shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want any of it to get in till I have seen my client,\u201d he said; \u201cbut I am entirely in your hands, and you must make such arrangements as you deem necessary.\u201d \u201cVery good,\u201d said the detective. \u201cFor the moment I do not think it is necessary to make any statement at all. If", "the reporters get hold of it, you had better tell them as much of the truth as you want to tell them, but the chances are that they won\u2019t even get to hear of it as you communicated directly to the Yard.\u201d The police officer spent half an hour collecting and making notes of such data as he was able to secure. At the end of that time the old Jewry sent a contingent of plain clothes policemen to remove the tools. The burglars had evidently entered the office after closing hours on the previous night, and had worked through the greater part of the evening, and possibly far into the night, in their successful attempt to cut out the lock of the safe. That they had been disturbed in their work was evident from the presence of the tools. This was not their first burglary in the City of London. During the previous six months the City had been startled by a succession of daring robberies, the majority of which had been successful. The men had shown extraordinary knowledge of the safe\u2019s contents, and it was this fact which had induced the police to narrow their circle of inquiry to three apparently innocent members of an outside broker\u2019s firm. But try as they might, no evidence could be secured which might even remotely associate them with the crime. Leslie remembered now that he had laughingly challenged Gilbert Standerton to qualify for the big reward which two firms at least had offered for the recovery of their stolen goods. \u201cAfter all,\u201d he said, \u201cwith your taste and genius, you would make an ideal thief-catcher.\u201d \u201cOr a thief,\u201d Gilbert had answered moodily. It had been one of his bad days, a day on which his altered prospects had preyed upon him. A telegram was waiting for Leslie when he entered the narrow portals of the City Proscenium Club. He took it down and opened it leisurely, and read its contents. A puzzled frown gathered on his forehead. It ran:-- \u201cI must see you this afternoon. Meet me at Charing Cross Station four o\u2019clock.--Gilbert.\u201d Punctually to the minute Leslie reached the terminus. He found Gilbert pacing to and fro beneath the clock, and was shocked at his appearance. \u201cWhat on earth is the matter with you?\u201d he asked. \u201cMatter with me?\u201d demanded the other hardly, \u201cwhat do you think is the matter with me?\u201d \u201cAre you in trouble?\u201d asked Leslie anxiously. He was genuinely fond of this friend of his. \u201cTrouble?\u201d Gilbert laughed bitterly. \u201cMy dear good chap, I am always in trouble. Haven\u2019t I been in trouble since the first day I met you? I want you to do something for me,\u201d he went on briskly. \u201cYou were talking the other day about money. I have recognised the tragedy of my own dependence. I have got to get money, and get it quick.\u201d He spoke briskly, and in a matter-of- fact tone, but Leslie heard a determination which had never formed", "part of his friend\u2019s equipment. \u201cI want to know something about shares and stocks and things of that sort,\u201d Gilbert went on. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to instruct me. I don\u2019t suppose you know much about it yourself\u201d--he smiled, with a return to the old good- humour--\u201cbut what little you know you\u2019ve got to impart to me.\u201d \u201cMy dear chap,\u201d protested the other, \u201cwhy the devil are you worrying about a thing like that for on your honeymoon? Where is your wife, by the way?\u201d \u201cOh, she\u2019s at the house,\u201d said the other shortly. He did not feel inclined to discuss her, and Leslie, in his amazement, had sufficient tact to pass over the subject. \u201cI can tell you all I know now, if you want a tip,\u201d he said. \u201cI want something bigger than a tip--I want investments. I want you to tell me something that will bring in about twelve thousand a year.\u201d Leslie stopped and looked at the other. \u201cAre you quite----?\u201d he began. Gilbert smiled, a crooked little smile. \u201cAm I right in my head?\u201d he finished. \u201cOh, yes, I am quite sane.\u201d \u201cBut don\u2019t you see,\u201d said the other, \u201cyou would want a little over a quarter of a million to bring in that interest.\u201d Gilbert nodded. \u201cI had an idea that some such amount was required. I want you to get me out between to-night and to-morrow a list of securities in which I can invest and which must be gilt-edged, and must, as I say, secure for me, or for my heirs, the sum I have mentioned.\u201d \u201cAnd did you,\u201d asked the indignant Leslie, \u201cbring me to this beastly place on a hot afternoon in June to pull my leg about your dream investments?\u201d But something in Gilbert\u2019s face checked his humour. \u201cSeriously, do you mean this?\u201d he asked. \u201cSeriously, I mean it.\u201d \u201cWell, then, I\u2019ll give you the list like a shot. What has happened--has uncle relented?\u201d Gilbert shook his head. \u201cHe is not likely to relent,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I had a note to-day from his secretary to tell me that he is pretty ill. I\u2019m awfully sorry.\u201d There was a genuine note of regret in his tone. \u201cHe is a decent old chap.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why he should hand over his wealth to the \u2018demnition bow-wows,\u2019\u201d quoted Leslie indignantly. \u201cBut why did you meet me here, my son? Your club is round the corner.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d said Gilbert; \u201cbut the club is--well, to tell you the truth,\u201d he said, \u201cI am giving up the club.\u201d \u201cGiving up your club?\u201d He stood squarely before the taller man. \u201cNow just tell me,\u201d he asked deliberately, \u201cwhat the Dickens all this means? You\u2019re giving up your club, you\u2019ll be giving up your Foreign Office job next, my Cr\u0153sus!\u201d Gilbert nodded. \u201cI have given up the Foreign Office work,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI want all the time I can get,\u201d he went on, speaking rapidly. \u201cI want every moment of the", "day for my own plans and my own schemes. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s all about, my dear chap\u201d--he laid his hand affectionately on the other\u2019s shoulder--\u201cbut just believe that I am in urgent need of all the advice you can give me, and I only want the advice for which I ask.\u201d \u201cWhich means that I am not to poke my nose in your business unless I have a special invitation card all printed and decorated. Very good,\u201d laughed Leslie. \u201cNow come along to my club. I suppose as a result of your brief married life you haven\u2019t conceived a dislike to all clubs?\u201d Gilbert made no answer, nor did they return again to the subject until they were ensconced in the spacious smoking-room of the Junior Terriers. For two hours the men sat there, Gilbert questioning eagerly, pointedly, jotting down notes upon a sheet of paper. The other answered, often with some difficulty, the running fire of questions which his friend put. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how little I knew,\u201d confessed the young man ruefully, as Gilbert wrote down the last answer to the very last question. \u201cWhat an encyclop\u00e6dic questioner you are; you\u2019re a born examiner, Gilbert.\u201d Gilbert smiled faintly as he slipped the sheet of paper into his pocket. \u201cBy the way,\u201d he said, as they were leaving the club, \u201cI made my will this morning and I want you to be my executor.\u201d Leslie pushed his hat back with a groan. \u201cYou\u2019re the most cheerless bird I\u2019ve met for quite a long time,\u201d he said in exasperation. \u201cYou were married yesterday, you\u2019re wandering round to-day with a face as long as an undertaker\u2019s tout--I understand such interesting and picturesque individuals exist in the East End of London-- you\u2019ve chucked up the billet that\u2019s bringing you in quite a lot of money, you\u2019ve discussed investments, and you\u2019ve made your will. You\u2019re a most depressing devil!\u201d Again Gilbert smiled: he was grimly amused. He shook hands with the young man before the club and called a taxi-cab to him. \u201cI\u2019m going to St. John\u2019s Wood. I suppose you\u2019re not going my way?\u201d \u201cI am relieved to hear that you are going to St. John\u2019s Wood,\u201d said the other with mock politeness. \u201cI feared you were going to the nearest crematorium.\u201d Gilbert found his wife in the study on his return. She was sitting on the big settee reading. The stress of the previous night had left no mark upon her beautiful face. She favoured him with a smile. Instinctively they had both adopted the attitude which best met the circumstances. Her respect for him had increased, even in that short space of time; he had so well mastered himself in that moment of terror--terror which in an indefinable way had communicated itself to her. He had met her the next morning at breakfast cheerfully; but she did not doubt that he had spent a sleepless night, for his eyes were heavy and tired, and in spite of his", "geniality his voice was sharp, as are the voices of men who have cheated Nature. He walked straight to his desk now. \u201cDo you want to be alone?\u201d she asked. He looked up with a start. \u201cNo, no,\u201d he said hastily, \u201cI\u2019ve no wish to be alone. I\u2019ve a little work to do, but you won\u2019t bother me. You ought to know,\u201d he said with an affectation of carelessness, \u201cthat I am resigning my post.\u201d \u201cYour post!\u201d she repeated. \u201cYes; I find I have so much to do, and the Foreign Office takes up so much of my time that I really can\u2019t spare, that it came to a question of giving up that or something else.\u201d He did not enlighten her as to what that \u201csomething else\u201d was, nor could she guess. Already he was an enigma to her; she found, strange though it seemed to her, a new interest in him. That there was some tragedy in his life, a tragedy unsuspected by her, she did not doubt. He had told her calmly and categorically the story of his disinheritance; at his request, she had put the whole of that story into a letter which she had addressed to her mother. She felt no qualms, no inward quaking, at the prospect of the inevitable encounter, though Mrs. Cathcart would be enraged beyond reason. Edith smiled a little to herself as she had stuck down the flap of the envelope. This was poetic justice, though she herself might be a life-long sufferer by reason of her worldly parent\u2019s schemings. She had hoped that as a result of that letter, posted early in the morning, her mother would have called and the interview would have been finished before her husband returned. But Gilbert had been in the house half an hour when the blow fell. The tinkle of the hall bell brought the girl to her feet: she had been waiting, her ears strained, for that aggressive ring. She herself flew down the stairs to open the door. Mrs. Cathcart entered without a word, and as the girl closed the door behind her she turned. \u201cWhere is that precious husband of yours?\u201d she asked in a choked voice. \u201cMy husband is in his study,\u201d said the girl calmly. \u201cDo you want him, mother?\u201d \u201cDo I want him?\u201d she repeated in a choked voice. Edith saw the glare in the woman\u2019s eyes, saw, too, the pinched and haggard cheek. For one brief moment she pitied this woman, who had seen all her dreams shattered at a moment when she had hoped that their realisation was inevitable. \u201cDoes he know I am coming?\u201d \u201cI think he rather expects you,\u201d said the girl dryly. \u201cI will see him by myself,\u201d said Mrs. Cathcart, turning half-way up the stairs. \u201cYou will see him with me, mother, or you will not see him at all,\u201d said the girl. \u201cYou will do as I tell you, Edith,\u201d stormed the woman. The girl smiled. \u201cMother,\u201d she said", "gently, \u201cyou have ceased to have any right to direct me. You have handed me over to another guardian whose claims are greater than yours.\u201d It was not a good preparation for the interview that was to follow. Edith recognised this even as she opened the door and ushered her mother in. When Gilbert saw who his visitor was he rose with a little bow. He did not offer his hand. He knew something of what this woman was feeling. \u201cWon\u2019t you sit down, Mrs. Cathcart?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll stand for what I have to say,\u201d she snapped. \u201cNow, what is the meaning of this?\u201d She threw down the letter which the girl had written, and which she had read and re-read until every word was engraven on her mind. \u201cIs it true,\u201d she asked fiercely, \u201cthat you are a poor man? That you have deceived us? That you have lied your way into a marriage----\u201d He held up his hand. \u201cYou seem to forget, Mrs. Cathcart,\u201d he said with dignity, \u201cthat the question of my position has already been discussed by you and me, and you have been most emphatic in impressing upon me the fact that no worldly considerations would weigh with you.\u201d \u201cWorldly!\u201d she sneered. \u201cWhat do you mean by worldly, Mr. Standerton? Are you not in the world? Do you not live in a house and eat bread and butter that costs money? Do you not use motor-cars that require money for their upkeep? Whilst I am living in the world and you are living in the world worldly considerations will always count. I thought you were a rich man; you\u2019re a beggar.\u201d He smiled a little contemptuously. \u201cA pretty mess you\u2019ve made of it,\u201d she said harshly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a woman who doesn\u2019t love you--I suppose you know that?\u201d He bowed. \u201cI know all that, Mrs. Cathcart,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew the worst when I learnt that. The fact that you so obviously planned the marriage because you thought that I was Sir John Standerton\u2019s heir does not hurt me, because I have met so many women like you, only\u201d--he shrugged his shoulders--\u201cI must confess that I thought you were a little different to the rest of worldly mothers--forgive me if I use that word again. But you are not any better--you may be a little worse,\u201d he said, his thoughtful eyes upon her face. He was looking at her with a curious something which the woman could not quite understand in his eyes. She had seen that look somewhere, and in spite of herself she shivered. The anger died away in fear. \u201cI wanted you to postpone this wedding,\u201d he went on softly. \u201cI had an especial reason, a reason I will not give you, but which will interest you in a few months\u2019 time. But you were fearful of losing your rich son-in-law. I didn\u2019t realise then that that was your fear. I have satisfied myself--it really doesn\u2019t matter how,\u201d he said steadily,", "\u201cthat you are more responsible than I for this good match.\u201d He was a changed man. Mrs. Cathcart in her gusty rage could recognise this: there was a new soul, a new spirit, a new determination, and--that was it!--a new and terrible ferocity which shone from his eyes and for the moment hardened his face till it was almost terrible to look upon. \u201cYour daughter married me under a misapprehension. She told you all that I had to tell--almost all,\u201d he corrected himself, \u201cand I anticipated this visit. Had you not come I should have sent for you. Your daughter is as free as the air as far as I am concerned. I suppose your worldliness extends to a knowledge of the law? She can sue for a divorce to-morrow, and attain it without any difficulty and with little publicity.\u201d A gleam of hope came to the woman\u2019s face. \u201cI never thought of that,\u201d she said half to herself. She turned quickly to her daughter, for she was a woman of action. \u201cGet your things and come with me.\u201d Edith did not stir. She stood the other side of the table, half facing her husband and wholly facing her mother. \u201cYou hear what Mr. Standerton says,\u201d said Mrs. Cathcart irritably. \u201cHe has opened a way of escape to you. What he says is true. A divorce can be obtained with no difficulty. Come with me. I will send for your clothes.\u201d Edith still did not move. Mrs. Cathcart, watching her, saw her features soften one by one, saw the lips part in a smile and the head fall back as peal after peal of clear laughter rang through the room. \u201cOh, mother!\u201d The infinite contempt of the voice struck the woman like the lash of a whip. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me! Go back with you? Divorce him? You\u2019re mad! If he had been a rich man indeed I might; but for the time being, though I do not love him, and though I should not blame him and do not blame him if he does not love me, my lot is cast with his, my place is here.\u201d \u201cMelodrama!\u201d said the elder woman angrily. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of truth and no end of decency in melodrama, Mrs. Cathcart,\u201d said Gilbert. His mother-in-law stood livid with rage, then turning, flung out of the room, and they heard the front door slam behind her. They looked at each other, this strangely-married pair, for the space of a few seconds, and then Gilbert held out his hand. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said. The girl dropped her eyes. \u201cYou have nothing to thank me for,\u201d she said listlessly. \u201cI have done you too much wrong for one little act to wipe out all the effects of my selfishness.\u201d CHAPTER VI. THE SAFE AGENCY The City of London is filled, as all the world knows, with flourishing and well-established businesses. It abounds in concerns which proclaim, either with dignity or flamboyantly, the fact that this shop", "stood where it did a hundred years ago, and is still being carried on by the legitimate descendants of its founders. There are companies and syndicates and trading associations, housed in ornate and elaborate buildings, suites of offices, which come into existence in the spring and fade away to nothingness in the winter, leaving a residue of unpaid petty accounts, and a landlord who has only this satisfaction--that he was paid his rent in advance. The tragedies of the City of London lay in a large sense round the ugly and unpretentious buildings of the Stock Exchange, and may be found in the seedy sprinkling of people who perambulate the streets round and round that grimy building like so many disembodied spirits. But the tragic gambler is not peculiar to the metropolis, and the fortunes made and lost in a day or in an hour has its counterpart in every city in the world where stock transactions are conducted. The picturesque sorrows of the city are represented in the popular mind with the human wreckage which strews the Embankment after dark, or goes shuffling along the edges of the pavement with downcast eyes seeking for discarded cigar ends. That is sorrowful enough, though the unhappy objects of our pity are considerably more satisfied with their lot than most people would imagine. The real tragedy and sorrow is to be found in the hundred and one little businesses which come into existence joyfully, and swallow up the savings of years of some two or three optimistic individuals. The flourishing note heads which are issued from brand new offices redolent of paint and fresh varnish, the virgin books imposingly displayed upon new shelves, the mass of correspondence which goes daily forth, the booklets and the leaflets, the explanatory tables and all the paraphernalia of the inexperienced advertiser, and the trickle of replies which come back--they are all part of the sad game. Some firms endeavour to establish themselves with violence, with a flourish of their largest trumpets. Some drift into business noiselessly, and in some mysterious way make good. Generally, one may suppose, they came with the invaluable asset of a \u201cconnection,\u201d shifting up from the suburbs to a more impressive address. One of the businesses which came into existence in London in the year 1924 was a firm which was defined in the telephone book and in the directory as \u201cThe St. Bride\u2019s Safe Company.\u201d It dealt in new and second-hand safes, strong rooms and all the cunning machinery of protection. In its one show-room were displayed safes of every make, new and old, gratings, burglar alarms, cash boxes, big and small, and the examples of all that iron and steel could do to resist the attention of the professional burglar. The principal of the business was apparently a Midland gentleman, who engaged a staff, including a manager and a salesman, by advertisement, interviewed the newly-engaged employees in the Midlands, and placed at the disposal of the manager, who came armed", "with unimpeachable testimonials, a sum of money sufficient to stock the store and carry on the business. He found more supplies from time to time in addition to the floating stock-in-trade, and though orders came very infrequently, the proprietor of the concern cheerfully continued to pay the large rent and the fairly generous salaries of the staff. The proprietor would occasionally visit the store, generally late at night, because, as he explained, his business in Birmingham required his constant attention. The new stock would be inspected; there would be a stock-taking of keys--these were usually kept in the private safe of the firm--and the proprietor would invariably express his satisfaction with the progress of the business. The manager himself never quite understood how his chief could make this office pay, but he evidently did a big trade in the provinces, because he was able to keep a large motor lorry and a driver, who from time to time appeared at the Bride Street store, brought a safe which would be unloaded, or carried away some purchased article to its new owners. The manager, a Mr. Timmings, and a respectable member of Balham society, could only imagine that the provincial branch of the business was fairly extensive. Sometimes the motor lorry would come with every evidence of having travelled for many miles, and it would seem that the business flourished, at any rate, at the Birmingham end. It was the day following the remarkable occurrence which is chronicled in the previous chapter that Gilbert Standerton decided amongst other things to purchase a safe. He needed one for his home, and there were reasons which need not be particularised why such an article of furniture was necessary. He had never felt the need of a safe before. When he did, he wanted to get one right away. It was unfortunate, or fortunate as the case may be, that this resolve did not come to him until an hour when most dealers in these unusual commodities were closed. It was after six when he arrived in the City. Mr. Timmings had gone away early that night, but he had left a most excellent deputy. The proprietor had come to London a little earlier that evening, and through the glass street doors Gilbert saw him and stared. The door was locked when he tried it, and with a cheery smile the new proprietor came forward himself and unbolted it. \u201cWe are closed,\u201d he said, \u201cand I am afraid my manager has gone home. Can I do anything for you?\u201d Gilbert looked at him. \u201cYes,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cI want to buy a safe.\u201d \u201cThen possibly I can help you,\u201d said the gentleman good-naturedly. \u201cWon\u2019t you come in?\u201d Gilbert entered, and the door was bolted behind him. \u201cWhat kind of safe do you want?\u201d asked the man. \u201cI want a small one,\u201d said the other. \u201cI would like a second-hand Chubb if you have one.\u201d \u201cI think I have got the very thing. I suppose", "you want it for your office?\u201d Gilbert shook his head. \u201cNo, I want it for my house,\u201d he said shortly, \u201cand I would like it delivered almost at once.\u201d He made an inspection of the various receptacles for valuables, and finally made a choice. He was on his way out, when he saw the great safe which stood at the end of the store. It was rather out of the ordinary, being about eight feet in height and about that width. It looked for all the world like a great steel wardrobe. Three sets of locks guarded the interior, and there was in addition a small combination lock. \u201cThat is a very handsome safe,\u201d said Gilbert. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d said the other carelessly. \u201cWhat is the value of that?\u201d \u201cIt is sold,\u201d said the proprietor a little brusquely. \u201cSold? I should like to see the interior,\u201d said Gilbert. The man smiled at him and stroked his upturned moustache thoughtfully. \u201cI am sorry I can\u2019t oblige you,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact is, the new proprietor took the keys when he completed the purchase.\u201d \u201cThat is very unfortunate,\u201d said Gilbert, \u201cfor this is one of the most interesting safes I have ever seen.\u201d \u201cIt is quite usual,\u201d said the other briefly. He tapped the sides with his knuckles in a reflective mood. \u201cIt is rather an expensive piece of property.\u201d \u201cIt looks as if you had it here permanently.\u201d \u201cIt does, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d said the other absently. \u201cI had to make it comfortable.\u201d He smiled, then he led the way to another part of the store. Gilbert would have paid by cheque, but something prevented him. He searched his pockets, and found the fifteen pounds which had been asked for the safe. With a pleasant good-night he was ushered out of the shop, and the door was closed behind him. \u201cWhere have I seen your face before?\u201d said the proprietor to himself. Though he was a very clever man in more ways than one, it is a curious fact that he never placed his customer until many months afterwards. CHAPTER VII. THE BANK SMASHER Three men sat in the inner room of a City office. The outer door was locked, the door communicating between the outer office and the sanctum was wide open. The men sat at a table, discussing a frugal lunch which had been brought in from a restaurant near by, and talking together in low tones. George Wallis, who spoke with such authority as to suggest that he held a leading position above and before the others, was a man of forty, inclined a little to stoutness, of middle height, and with no distinguishing features save the short bristling moustache and the jet-black eyebrows which gave his face a somewhat sinister appearance. His eyes were tired and lazy, his square jaw bespoke immense determination, and the hands which played idly with a pen were small but strong; they were the hands of an artist, and indeed George Wallis, under one", "name or another, was known as an artist in his particular profession in every police bureau on the Continent. Callidino, the little Italian at his side, was neat and dapper. His hair was rather long, he suggested rather the musical enthusiast than the cool-headed man of business. And yet this dapper Italian was known as the most practical of the remarkable trio which for many years had been the terror of every bank president in France. The third was Persh, a stout man with a pleasant, florid face, and a trim cavalry moustache, who, despite his bulk, was a man of extraordinary agility, and his escape from Devil\u2019s Island and his subsequent voyage to Australia in an open boat will be fresh in the minds of the average newspaper readers. They made no disguise as to their identities, they did not evade the frank questioning which was their lot when the City Police smelt them out and came in to investigate the affairs of this \u201coutside brokers\u2019\u201d establishment. The members of the City force were a little disappointed to discover that quite a legitimate business was being done. You cannot quarrel even with convicted bank robbers if they choose to get their living by any way which, however much discredited, is within the law; and beyond warning those of their clients with whom they could get in touch that the heads of this remarkable business were notorious criminals, the police must needs sit by and watch, satisfied that sooner or later the men would make a slip that would bring them within the scope of police action. \u201cAnd they will have to wait a jolly long time,\u201d said Wallis. He looked round his \u201cBoard\u201d with an amused smile. \u201cHave they been in to-day?\u201d asked Callidino. \u201cThey have been in to-day,\u201d said Wallis gravely. \u201cThey have searched our books and our desks and our clothes, and even the legs of our office stools.\u201d \u201cAn indelicate proceeding,\u201d said Persh cheerfully. \u201cAnd what did they find, George?\u201d George smiled. \u201cThey found all there was to be found,\u201d he said. \u201cI suppose it was the burglary at the Bond Guarantees that I have been reading about that\u2019s excited them,\u201d said the Italian coolly. \u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Wallis, with grave indifference. \u201cIt is pretty terrible to have names such as we possess. Seriously,\u201d he went on, \u201cI am not very much afraid of the police, even suppose there was anything to find. I haven\u2019t met one of them who has the intelligence of that cool devil we met at the Foreign Office, when I had to answer some questions about Persh\u2019s unique experiences on Devil\u2019s Island.\u201d \u201cWhat was his name?\u201d asked Persh, interested. \u201cSomething associated in my mind with South Africa--oh, yes, Standerton. A cool beast--I met him at Epsom the other day,\u201d said Wallis. \u201cHe\u2019s lost in a place like the Foreign Office. Do you remember that quick run through he gave me, Persh?\u201d The other nodded. \u201cBefore I knew where I was", "I admitted that I\u2019d been in Huntingdonshire the same week as Lady Perkinton\u2019s jewels were taken. If he\u2019d had another five minutes I guess he\u2019d have known\u201d--he lowered his voice to little more than a whisper--\u201call this hidden treasure which the English police are seeking was cached.\u201d The men laughed as at some great joke. \u201cTalking of cool people,\u201d said Wallis, \u201cdo you recall that weird devil who held us up in Hatton Garden?\u201d \u201cHave you found him?\u201d asked Callidino. George shook his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he said slowly, \u201conly I\u2019m rather afraid of him.\u201d Which was a remarkable confession for him to make. He changed the subject abruptly. \u201cI suppose you people know,\u201d said Wallis, \u201cthat the police are particularly active just now? I\u2019ve reason to be aware of the fact, because they have just concluded a most exhaustive search of my private belongings.\u201d He did not exaggerate. The police were, indeed, most eager for some clue to associate these three known criminals with the acts of the past month. Half an hour later Wallis left the building. He paused in the entrance hall of the big block of offices, lighted a cigar with an air that betokened his peace with the world and his approval of humanity. As his foot touched the pavement a tall man stepped to his side. Wallis looked up quickly and gave a little nod. \u201cI want you,\u201d said the tall man coldly. \u201cDo you indeed?\u201d said Wallis with exaggerated interest. \u201cAnd what may you want with me?\u201d \u201cYou come along with me, and not so much of your lip,\u201d said the man. He called a cab, and the two men were rapidly driven to the nearest City police station. Wallis continued smoking his cigar, without any outward indication of apprehension. He would have chatted very gaily with the officer who had effected his arrest, but the officer himself was in no mood for light humour. He was hustled into the charge room and brought before the inspector\u2019s desk. That officer looked up with a nod. He was more genial than his captor. \u201cWell, Wallis,\u201d he said with a smile, \u201cwe want some information from you.\u201d \u201cYou always want information from somebody,\u201d said the man with cold insolence. \u201cHave you had another burglary?\u201d The inspector nodded. \u201cTut, tut!\u201d said the prisoner with an affectation of distress, \u201chow very annoying for you Mr. Whitling. I suppose you have got the culprit?\u201d he asked blandly. \u201cI\u2019ve got you at present,\u201d said the calm inspector. \u201cI should not be surprised if I had also got the culprit. Can you explain where you were last night?\u201d \u201cWith the greatest of pleasure,\u201d said Wallis; \u201cI was dining with a friend.\u201d \u201cHis name?\u201d The other shrugged his shoulders. \u201cHis name is immaterial. I was dining with a friend whose name does not matter. Put that down, inspector.\u201d \u201cAnd where were you dining with this unknown friend?\u201d asked the imperturbable official. Wallis named a restaurant in Wardour Street. \u201cAt what hour were", "you dining?\u201d asked the inspector patiently. \u201cBetween the hours of eight and eleven,\u201d said the man, \u201cas the proprietor of the restaurant will testify.\u201d The inspector smiled to himself. He knew the restaurant and knew the proprietor. His testimony would not carry a great deal of weight with a jury. \u201cHave you anybody respectable,\u201d he asked, \u201cwho will vouch for the fact that you were there, other than your unknown friend and Signor Villimicci?\u201d Wallis nodded. \u201cI might name, with due respect,\u201d he said, \u201cSergeant Colebrook, of the Central Investigation Department of Scotland Yard.\u201d He was annoyingly bland. The inspector looked up sharply. \u201cIs he going to vouch for you?\u201d he asked. \u201cHe was watching me the whole of the time, disguised, I think, as a gentleman. At least, he was in evening dress, and he was quite different from the waiters. You see, he was sitting down.\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d said the inspector. He put down his pen. \u201cIt was rather amusing to be watched by a real detective-sergeant, from that most awe- inspiring wilderness of bricks,\u201d the man continued. \u201cI quite liked it, though I am afraid the poor fellow was bored sooner than I was.\u201d \u201cI understand,\u201d said the inspector, \u201cthat you were being watched from eight o\u2019clock last night till----?\u201d He paused inquiringly. \u201cTill near midnight, I should imagine. Until our dress- suited detective, looking tragically like a detective all the time, had escorted me to the front door of my flat.\u201d \u201cI can verify that in a minute,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cGo into the parade room.\u201d Wallis strolled unconcernedly into the inner room whilst the inspector manipulated the telephone. In five minutes the prisoner was sent for. \u201cYou\u2019re all right,\u201d said the inspector. \u201cClean bill for you, Wallis.\u201d \u201cI am glad to hear it,\u201d said Wallis. \u201cVery relieved indeed!\u201d He sighed heavily. \u201cNow that I am embarked upon what I might term a legalised form of thefts from the public, it is especially pleasing to me to know that my actions are approved by the police.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t approve of everything you do,\u201d said the inspector. He was an annoying man, Wallis thought; he would neither lose his temper nor be rude. \u201cYou can go now--sorry to have bothered you.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d said the polite man with a little bow. \u201cBy the way, before you go,\u201d said the inspector, \u201cjust come into my inner office, will you?\u201d Wallis followed him. The inspector closed the door behind them. They were alone. \u201cWallis, do you know there is a reward of some twelve thousand pounds for the detection of the men engaged in these burglaries?\u201d \u201cYou surprise me,\u201d said Mr. Wallis, lifting his eyebrows. \u201cI don\u2019t surprise you,\u201d said the inspector; \u201cin fact, you know much more about it than I do. And I tell you this, that we are prepared to go to any lengths to track this gang, or, at any rate, to put an end to its operations. Look here, George,\u201d he tapped the", "other on the chest with his strong, gnarled finger, \u201cis it a scream?\u201d \u201cA scream?\u201d Mr. Wallis was puzzled innocence itself. \u201cWill you turn King\u2019s evidence?\u201d said the other shortly. \u201cI should be most happy,\u201d said Wallis, with a helpless shrug, \u201cbut how can I turn King\u2019s evidence about a matter on which I am absolutely uninformed? The reward is monstrously tempting. If I had companions in crime I should need very little persuading. My conscience is a matter of constant adjustment. It is rather like the foot-rule which shoemakers employ to measure their customers\u2019 feet-- terrifically adjustable. It has a sliding scale which goes up and down.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any more about your conscience,\u201d said the officer wearily. \u201cDo you scream or don\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t scream,\u201d said Mr. Wallis emphatically. The inspector jerked his head sideways, and with the bow which the invitation had interrupted, Mr. Wallis walked out into the street. He knew, no one better, how completely every action of his was watched. He knew, even as he left the station, that the seemingly idle loafer on the corner of the street had picked him up, would follow him until he handed him over to yet another plain-clothes officer for observation. From beat to beat, from one end of the City to another, those vigilant eyes would never leave him; whilst he slept, the door, back and front of his lodging would be watched. He could not move without all London--all the London that mattered as far as he was concerned--knowing everything about that move. His home was the upper part of a house over a tobacconist\u2019s in a small street off Charing Cross Road. And to his maisonette he made a leisurely way, not hastening his steps any the more because he knew that on one side of the street an innocent commercial traveller, and on the other a sandwich man apparently trudging homeward with his board, were keeping him under observation. He stopped to buy some cigars in the Charing Cross Road, crossed near the Alhambra, and ten minutes later was unlocking the door of the narrow passage which ran by the side of the shop, and gave him private access to the suite above. It was a room comfortably furnished and giving evidence of some taste. Large divan chairs formed a feature of the furnishing, and the prints, though few, were interesting by reason of their obvious rarity. He did not trouble to make an examination of the room, or of the remainder of the maisonette he rented. If the police had been, they had been. If they had not, it did not matter. They could find nothing. He had a good conscience, so far as a man\u2019s conscience may be good who fears less for the consequence of his deeds than for the apparent, the obvious and the discoverable consequences. He rang a bell, and after a little delay an old woman answered the call. \u201cMake me some tea,", "Mrs. Skard,\u201d he said. \u201cHas anybody called?\u201d The old woman looked up to the ceiling for inspiration. \u201cOnly the man about the gas,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly the man about the gas,\u201d repeated George Wallis admiringly. \u201cWasn\u2019t he awfully surprised to find that we didn\u2019t have gas at all?\u201d The old lady looked at him in some amazement. \u201cHe did say he had come to see about the gas,\u201d she said, \u201cand then when he found we had no gas he said \u2018electricity\u2019--a most absent-minded young man.\u201d \u201cThey are that way, Mrs. Skard,\u201d said her master tolerantly; \u201cthey fall in love, don\u2019t you know, round about this season of the year, and when their minds become occupied with other and more pleasant thoughts than gas mantles and incandescent lights they become a little confused. I suppose he did not bother you--he told you you need not wait?\u201d he suggested. \u201cQuite right, sir,\u201d said Mrs. Skard. \u201cHe said he would do all he had to do without assistance.\u201d \u201cAnd I will bet you he did it,\u201d said George Wallis with boisterous good humour. Undisturbed by the knowledge that his rooms had been searched by an industrious detective, he sat for an hour reading an American magazine. At six o\u2019clock a taxi-cab drove into the street and pulled up before the entrance of his flat. The driver, a stoutish man with a beard, looked helplessly up and down seeking a number, and one of the two detectives who had been keeping observation on the house walked across the road casually towards him. \u201cDo you want to find a number, mate?\u201d he asked. \u201cI want No. 43,\u201d said the cabman. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d said the officer. He saw the cabman ring, and having observed that he entered the door, which was closed behind him, he walked back to his co-worker. \u201cGeorge is going to take a little taxi drive,\u201d he said; \u201cwe will see where he goes.\u201d The man who had waited on the other side of the road nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose he will go anywhere worth following, but I have the car waiting round the corner.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll car him,\u201d said the second man bitterly. \u201cDid you hear what he told Inspector Whitling of the City Police about me last night?\u201d The first detective was considerably interested. \u201cNo, I should like to hear.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d began the man, and then thought better of it. It was nothing to his credit that he should keep a man under observation three hours, and that the quarry should be aware all the time that he was being watched. \u201cHullo!\u201d he said as the door of No. 43 opened, \u201chere is our man.\u201d He threw a swift glance along the street, and saw that the hired motor-car which had been provided for his use was waiting. \u201cHere he comes,\u201d he said, but it was not the man he expected. The bearded chauffeur came out alone, waved a farewell to somebody in the hall-way whom they could not see, and", "having started his engine with great deliberation, got upon his seat, and the taxi-cab moved slowly away. \u201cGeorge is not going,\u201d said the detective. \u201cThat means that we shall have to stay here for another two or three hours--there is his light.\u201d For four long hours they kept their vigil, and never once was a pair of eyes taken from the only door through which George Wallis could make his exit. There was no other way by which he could leave, of that they were assured. Behind the house was a high wall, and unless the man was working in collusion with half the respectable householders, not only in that street but of Charing Cross Road, he could not by any possible chance leave his flat. At half-past ten the taxi-cab they had seen drove back to the door of the flat, and the driver was admitted. He evidently did not expect to stay long, for he did not switch off his engine; as a matter of fact, he was not absent from his car longer than thirty seconds. He came back almost immediately, climbed up on to his seat and drove away. \u201cI wonder what the game is?\u201d asked the detective, a little puzzled. \u201cHe has been to take a message somewhere,\u201d said the other. \u201cI think we ought to have found out.\u201d Ten minutes later Inspector Goldberg, of Scotland Yard, drove into the street and sprang from his car opposite the men. \u201cHas Wallis returned?\u201d he asked quickly. \u201cReturned!\u201d repeated the puzzled detective, \u201che has not gone out yet.\u201d \u201cHas not gone out?\u201d repeated the inspector with a gasp. \u201cA man answering to his description was seen leaving the City branch of the Goldsmiths\u2019 Guild half an hour ago. The safe has been forced and twenty thousand pounds\u2019 worth of jewelry has been taken.\u201d There was a little silence. \u201cWell, sir,\u201d said the subordinate doggedly, \u201cone thing I will swear, and it is that George Wallis has not left this house to-night.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true, sir,\u201d said the second man. \u201cThe sergeant and I have not left this place since Wallis went in.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d said the bewildered detective-inspector, \u201cit must be Wallis, no other man could have done the job as he did it.\u201d \u201cIt could not have been, sir,\u201d persisted the watcher. \u201cThen who in the name of Heaven did the job?\u201d snapped the inspector. His underlings wisely offered no solution. CHAPTER VIII. THE WIFE WHO DID NOT LOVE Mr. Warrell, of the firm of Warrell & Bird, prided himself upon being a man of the world, and was wont to admit, in a mild spirit of boastfulness, in which even middle-aged and respectable gentlemen occasionally indulge, that he had been in some very awkward situations. He had inferred that he had escaped from those situations with some credit to himself. Every stockbroker doing a popular and extensive business is confronted sooner or later with the delicate task of explaining to a rash and hazardous speculator exactly how", "rashly and at what hazard he has invested his money. Mr. Warrell had had occasion before to break, as gently as it was possible to break, unpleasant news of Mrs. Cathcart\u2019s unsuccess. But never before had he been face to face with a situation so full of possibilities for disagreeable consequences as this which now awaited him. The impassive Cole admitted him, and the face of Cole fell, for he knew the significance of these visits, having learnt in that mysterious way which servants have of discovering the inward secrets of their masters\u2019 and mistresses\u2019 bosoms, that the arrival of Mr. Warrell was usually followed by a period of retrenchment economy and reform. \u201cMadam will see you at once,\u201d was the message he returned with. A few minutes later Mrs. Cathcart sailed into the drawing-room, a little harder of face than usual, thought Mr. Warrell, and wondered why. \u201cWell, Warrell,\u201d she said briskly, \u201cwhat machination of the devil has brought you here? Sit down, won\u2019t you?\u201d He seated himself deliberately. He placed his hat upon the floor, and peeling his gloves, deposited them with unnecessary care in the satin-lined interior. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Mrs. Cathcart impatiently. \u201cAre those Canadian Pacifics down again?\u201d \u201cThey are slightly up,\u201d said Mr. Warrell, with a smile which was intended both to conciliate and to flatter. \u201cI think your view on Canadian Pacifics is a very sound one.\u201d He knew that Mrs. Cathcart would ordinarily desire nothing better than a tribute to her judgment, but now she dismissed the compliment, realising that he had not come all the way from Throgmorton Street to say kindly things about her perspicacity. \u201cI will say all that is in my mind,\u201d Mr. Warrell went on, choosing his words and endeavouring by the adoption of a pained smile to express in some tangible form his frankness. \u201cYou owe us some seven hundred pounds, Mrs. Cathcart.\u201d She nodded. \u201cYou have ample security,\u201d she said. \u201cThat I realise,\u201d he agreed, addressing the ceiling, \u201cbut the question is whether you are prepared to make good in actual cash the differences which are due to us.\u201d \u201cThere is no question at all about it,\u201d she said brusquely, \u201cso far as I am concerned, I cannot raise seven hundred shillings.\u201d \u201cSuppose,\u201d suggested Mr. Warrell, with his eyes still upraised, \u201csuppose I could find somebody who would be willing to buy your necklace--I think that was the article you deposited with us--for a thousand pounds?\u201d \u201cIt is worth considerably more than that,\u201d said Mrs. Cathcart sharply. \u201cPossibly,\u201d said the other, \u201cbut I am anxious to keep things out of the paper.\u201d He had launched his bombshell. \u201cExactly what do you mean?\u201d she demanded, rising to her feet. She stood glowering down at him. \u201cDo not misunderstand me,\u201d he said hastily. \u201cI will explain in a sentence. Your diamond necklace has been stolen from my safe.\u201d \u201cStolen!\u201d She went white. \u201cStolen,\u201d said Mr. Warrell, \u201cby a gang of burglars which has been engaged in its", "operations for the past twelve months in the City of London. You see, my dear Mrs. Cathcart,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat it is a very embarrassing situation for both of us. I do not want my clients to know that I accept jewels from ladies as collateral security against differences, and you,\u201d he was so rude as to point to emphasise his words, \u201cdo not, I imagine, desire your friends to know that it was necessary for you to deposit those jewels.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders. \u201cOf course, I could have reported the matter to the police, sent out a description of the necklace, and possibly recovered the loss from an insurance company, but that I do not wish to do.\u201d He might have added, this good business man, that his insurance policy would not have covered such a loss, for when premiums are adjusted to cover the risk of a stockbroker\u2019s office, they do not as a rule foreshadow the possibility of a jewel robbery. \u201cI am willing to stand the loss myself,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat is to say, I am willing to make good a reasonable amount out of my own pocket, as much for your sake as for mine. On the other hand, if you do not agree to my suggestion, I have no other alternative than to report the matter very, very fully, very fully,\u201d he repeated with emphasis, \u201cto the police and to the press. Now, what do you think?\u201d Mrs. Cathcart might have said in truth that she did not know what to think. The necklace was a valuable one, and there were other considerations. Mr. Warrell was evidently thinking of its sentimental value, for he went on-- \u201cBut for the fact that jewels of this kind have associations I might suggest that your new son-in-law would possibly replace your loss.\u201d She turned upon him with a hard smile. \u201cMy new son-in-law!\u201d she scoffed. \u201cGood Lord!\u201d Warrell knew Standerton, and regarded him as one of Fortune\u2019s favourites, and was in no doubt as to his financial stability. The contempt in the woman\u2019s tone shocked him as only a City man can be shocked by a whisper against the credit of gilt-edged stock. For the moment he forgot the object of his visit. He would have liked to have asked for an explanation, but he felt that it did not lie within the province of Mrs. Cathcart\u2019s broker to demand information upon her domestic affairs. \u201cIt is a pretty rotten mess you have got me into, Warrell,\u201d she said, and got up. He rose with her, picked up his hat, and exhumed his buried gloves. \u201cIt is very awkward indeed,\u201d he said, \u201ctremendously awkward for you, and tremendously awkward for me, my dear Mrs. Cathcart. I am sure you will pity me in my embarrassment.\u201d \u201cI am too busy pitying myself,\u201d she said shortly. She sat in the drawing-room alone after the broker\u2019s departure. What should she do? For what Warrell did not know was", "that the necklace was not hers. It had been one which the old Colonel had had reset for his daughter, and which had been bequeathed to the girl in her father\u2019s will. A family circle which consists of a mother and a daughter exercises communal rights over property which may appear curious to families more extensive in point of number. Though Edith had known the jewel was hers, she had not demurred when her mother had worn it, and had never even hinted that she would prefer to include it amongst the meagre stock of jewellery in her own case. Yet it had always been known as \u201cEdith\u2019s necklace.\u201d Mrs. Cathcart had referred to it herself in these terms, and an uncomfortable feature of their estrangement had been the question of the necklace and its retention by the broker. Mrs. Cathcart shrugged her shoulders. There was nothing to be done; she must trust to luck. She could not imagine that Edith would ever feel the need of the jewel; yet if her husband was poor, and she was obsessed with this absurd sense of loyalty to the man who had deceived her, there might be a remote possibility that from a sheer quixotic desire to help her husband, she would make inquiries as to the whereabouts of the necklace. Edith was not like that, thought Mrs. Cathcart. It was a comforting thought as she made her way up the stairs to her room. She stopped half-way up to allow the maid to overtake her with the letters which had arrived at that moment. With a little start she recognised upon the first of these the handwriting of her daughter, and tore open the envelope. The letter was brief:-- \u201cDear Mother,\u201d it ran, \u201cWould you please arrange for me to have the necklace which father left to me. I feel now that I must make some sort of display if only for my husband\u2019s sake.\u201d The letter dropped from Mrs. Cathcart\u2019s hand. She stood on the stairs transfixed. * * * * Edith Standerton was superintending the arrangement of the lunch table when her husband came in. Life had become curiously systematised in the St. John\u2019s Wood house. To neither of the young people had it seemed possible that they could live together as now they did, in perfect harmony, in sympathy, yet with apparently no sign of love or demonstration of affection on either side. To liken them to brother and sister would be hardly descriptive of their friendship. They lacked the mutual knowledge of things, and the common interest which brother and sister would have. They wanted, too, an appreciation of one another\u2019s faults and virtues. They were strangers, and every day taught each something about the other. Gilbert learnt that this quiet girl, whose sad grey eyes had hinted at tragedy, had a sense of humour, could laugh on little provocation, and was immensely shrewd in her appraisement of humanity. She, for her part, had found a force", "she had not reckoned on, a vitality and a doggedness of purpose which she had never seen before their marriage. He could be entertaining, too, in the rare intervals when they were alone together. He was a traveller, had visited Persia, Arabia, and the less known countries of Eastern Asia. She never referred again to the events of that terrible marriage night. Here, perhaps, her judgment was at fault. She had seen a player with a face of extraordinary beauty, and had given perhaps too much attention to this minor circumstance. Somewhere in her husband\u2019s heart was a secret, what that secret was she could only guess. She guessed that it was associated in some way with a woman--therein the woman in her spoke. She had no feeling of resentment either towards her husband or to the unknown who had sent a message through the trembling strings of her violin upon that wedding night. Only, she told herself, it was \u201ccurious.\u201d She wanted to know what it was all about. She had the healthy curiosity of the young. The revelation might shock her, might fill her with undying contempt for the man whose name she bore, but she wanted to know. It piqued her too, after a while, that he should have any secrets from her--a strange condition of mind, remembering the remarkable relationship in which they stood, and yet one quite understandable. Though they had not achieved the friendly and peculiar relationship of man and wife, there had grown up between them a friendship which the girl told herself (and did her best to believe) was of a more enduring character than that which marriage qua marriage could produce. It was a comradeship in which much was taken for granted; she took for granted that he loved her, and entered into the marriage with no other object. That was a comforting basis for friendship with any woman. For his part, he took it for granted that she had a soul above deception, that she was frank even though in her frankness she wounded him almost to death. He detected in that an unusual respect for himself, though in his more logical mood he argued she would have acted as honourably to any man. She herself wove into the friendship a peculiar sexless variety of romance--sexless since she thought she saw in it an accomplished ideal towards which the youth of all ages have aspired without any conspicuous success. There is no man or woman in the world who does not think that the chance in a million may be his or hers; there is no human creature so diffident that it does not imagine in its favour is created exception to evident and universal rules. Plato may have stopped dead in his conduct of other friendships, his philosophies may have frizzled hopelessly and helplessly, and have been evaporated to thin vapour before the fire of natural love. A thousand witnesses may rise to testify to the futility of friendship", "in two people of opposite sex, but there always is the \u201cyou\u201d and the \u201cme\u201d in the world, who defies experience, and comes with sublime faith to show how different will be the result to that which has attended all previous experiments. As she told herself, if there had been the slightest spark of love in her bosom for this young man who had come into her life with some suddenness, and had gone out in a sense so violently, only to return in another guise, if there had been the veriest smouldering ember of the thing called love in her heart, she would have been jealous, just a little jealous, of the interests which drew him away from her every night, and often brought him home when the grey dawn was staining the blue of the East. She had watched him once from her window, and had wondered vaguely what he found to do at night. Was he seeking relaxation from an intolerable position? He never gave her the impression that it was intolerable. There was comfort in that thought. Was there--somebody else? Here was a question to make her knit her brows, this loveless wife. Once she found herself, to her intense amazement, on the verge of tears at the thought. She went through all the stages of doubt and decision, of anger and contrition, which a young wife more happily circumstanced might have experienced. Who was the violin player with the beautiful face? What part had she taken in Gilbert\u2019s life? One thing she did know, her husband was gambling on the Stock Exchange. At first she did not realise that he could be so commonplace. She had always regarded him as a man to whom vulgar money-grabbing would be repugnant. He had surrendered his position at the Foreign Office; he was now engaged in some business which neither discussed. She thought many things, but until she discovered the contract note of a broker upon his desk, she had never suspected success on the Stock Exchange as the goal of his ambition. This transaction seemed an enormous one to her. There were tens of thousands of shares detailed upon the note. She knew very little about the Stock Exchange, except that there had been mornings when her mother had been unbearable as a result of her losses. Then it occurred to her, if he were in business--a vague term which meant anything--she might do something more than sit at home and direct his servants. She might help him also in another way. Business men have expedient dinners, give tactful theatre parties. And many men have succeeded because they have wives who are wise in their generation. It was a good thought. She held a grand review of her wardrobe, and posted the letter which so completely destroyed her mother\u2019s peace of mind. Gilbert had been out all the morning, and he came back from the City looking rather tired. An exchange of smiles, a little strained and", "a little hard on one side, a little wistful and a little sad on the other, had become the conventional greeting between the two, so too had the inquiry, \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d which was the legitimate property of whosoever thought first of this original question. They were in the midst of lunch when she asked suddenly-- \u201cWould you like me to give a dinner party?\u201d He looked up with a start. \u201cA dinner party!\u201d he said incredulously, then, seeing her face drop, and realising something of the sacrifice which she might be making, he added, \u201cI think it is an excellent idea. Whom would you like to invite?\u201d \u201cAny friends you have,\u201d she said, \u201cthat rather nice man Mr. Frankfort, and---- Who else?\u201d she asked. He smiled a little grimly. \u201cI think that rather nice man Mr. Frankfort about exhausts the sum of my friends,\u201d he said with a little laugh. \u201cWe might ask Warrell.\u201d \u201cWho is Warrell? Oh, I know,\u201d she said quickly, \u201che is mother\u2019s broker.\u201d He looked at her curiously. \u201cYour mother\u2019s broker,\u201d he repeated slowly, \u201cis he really?\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy what?\u201d he evaded. \u201cWhy did you say that so queerly?\u201d \u201cI did not know that I did,\u201d he said carelessly, \u201conly somehow one doesn\u2019t associate your mother with a broker. Yet I suppose she finds an agent necessary in these days. You see, he is my broker too.\u201d \u201cWho else?\u201d she asked. \u201cOn my side of the family,\u201d he said with mock solemnity, \u201cI can think of nobody. What about your mother?\u201d \u201cI could ask one or two nice people,\u201d she went on, ignoring the suggestion. \u201cWhat about your mother?\u201d he said again. She looked up, her eyes filled with tears. \u201cPlease do not be horrid,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know that is impossible.\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d he answered cheerfully. \u201cI made the suggestion in all good faith; I think it is a good one. After all, there is no reason why this absurd quarrel should go on. I admit I felt very sore with her; but then I even felt sore with you!\u201d He looked at her not unkindly. \u201cThe soreness is gradually wearing away,\u201d he said. He spoke half to himself, though he looked at the girl. It seemed to her that he was trying to convince himself of something in which he did not wholly believe. \u201cIt is extraordinary,\u201d he said, \u201chow little things, little worries, and petty causes for unhappiness disappear in the face of a really great trouble.\u201d \u201cWhat is your great trouble?\u201d she asked, quick to seize the advantage which he had given her in that unguarded moment. \u201cNone,\u201d he said. His tone was a little louder than usual, it was almost defiant. \u201cI am speaking hypothetically. \u201cI have no trouble save the very obvious troubles of life,\u201d he went on. \u201cYou were a trouble to me for quite a little time, but you are not any more.\u201d \u201cI am glad you said that,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI", "want to be real good friends with you, Gilbert--I want to be a real good friend to you. I have made rather a hash of your life, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d She had risen from the table and stood looking down at him. He shook his head. \u201cI do not think you have,\u201d he said, \u201cnot the hash that you imagine. Other circumstances have conspired to disfigure what was a pleasant outlook. It is unfortunate that our marriage has not proved to be all that I dreamt it would be, but then dreams are very unstable foundations to the fabric of life. You would not think that I was a dreamer, would you?\u201d he said quickly with that ready smile of his, those eyes that creased into little lines at the corners. \u201cYou would not imagine me as a romancist, though I am afraid I was.\u201d \u201cYou are, you mean,\u201d she corrected. He made no reply to that. The question of the dinner came up later, when he was preparing to go out. \u201cYou would not like to stay and talk it over, I suppose,\u201d she suggested a little timidly. He hesitated. \u201cThere is nothing I should like better,\u201d he said, \u201cbut\u201d--he looked at his watch. She pressed her lips together, and for one moment felt a wave of unreasoning anger sweeping over her. It was absurd, of course, he always went out at this time, and there was really no reason why he should stay in. \u201cWe can discuss it another time,\u201d she said coldly, and left him without a further word. He waited until he heard the door close in her room above, and then he went out with a little smile in which there were tears almost, but in which there was no merriment. He left the house at a propitious moment; had he waited another five minutes he would have met his mother-in-law. Mrs. Cathcart had made up her mind to \u201cown up\u201d and had come in person to make the confession. It was a merciful providence, so she told herself, that had taken Gilbert out of the way; that he had gone out she discovered before she had been in the house four minutes, and she discovered it by the very simple process of demanding from Gilbert\u2019s servant whether his master was at home. Edith heard of her mother\u2019s arrival without surprise. She supposed that Mrs. Cathcart had come to hand the necklace to its lawful owner. She felt some pricking of conscience as she came down the stairs to meet her mother; had she not been unnecessarily brusque in her demand! She was a tender soul, and had a proper and natural affection for the elder woman. The fear that she might have hurt her feelings, and that that hurt might be expressed at the interview gave her a little qualm as she opened the drawing-room door. Mrs. Cathcart was coolness itself. You might have thought that never a scene had occurred between these two women", "which could be remembered with unkindliness. No reference was made to the past, and Edith was glad. It was not her desire that she should live on bad terms with her mother. She understood her too well, which was unfortunate for both, and it would be all the happier for them if they could maintain some pretence of friendship. Mrs. Cathcart came straight to the point. \u201cI suppose you know why I have called,\u201d she said, after the first exchange. \u201cI suppose you have brought the necklace,\u201d said the girl with a smile. \u201cYou do not think I am horrid to ask for it, but I feel I ought to do something for Gilbert.\u201d \u201cI think you might have chosen another subject for your first letter,\u201d said the elder woman grimly, \u201cbut still----\u201d Edith made no reply. It was useless to argue with her mother. Mrs. Cathcart had a quality which is by no means rare in the total of human possessions, the quality of putting other people in the wrong. \u201cI am more sorry,\u201d Mrs. Cathcart resumed, \u201cbecause I am not in a position to give you your necklace.\u201d The girl stared at her mother in wonder. \u201cWhy! Whatever do you mean, mother?\u201d she asked. Mrs. Cathcart carefully avoided her eyes. \u201cI have had losses on the Stock Exchange,\u201d she said. \u201cI suppose you know that your father left us just sufficient to starve on, and whatever luxury and whatever comfort you have had has been due to my own individual efforts? I have lost a lot of money over Canadian Pacifics,\u201d she said bluntly. \u201cWell?\u201d asked the girl, wondering what was coming next, and fearing the worst. \u201cI made a loss of seven hundred pounds with a firm of stockbrokers,\u201d Mrs. Cathcart continued, \u201cand I deposited your necklace with the firm as security.\u201d The girl gasped. \u201cI intended, of course, redeeming it, but an unfortunate thing happened--the safe was burgled and the necklace was stolen.\u201d Edith Standerton stared at the other. The question of the necklace did not greatly worry her, yet she realised now that she had depended rather more upon it than she had thought. It was a little nest-egg against a bad time, which, if Gilbert spoke the truth, might come at any moment. \u201cIt cannot be helped,\u201d she said. She did not criticise her mother or offer any opinion upon the impropriety of offering as security for debt articles which are the property of somebody else. Such criticism would have been wasted, and the effort would have been entirely superfluous. \u201cWell,\u201d asked Mrs. Cathcart, \u201cwhat have you got to say?\u201d The girl shrugged her shoulders. \u201cWhat can I say, mother? The thing is lost, and there is an end to it. Do the firm offer any compensation?\u201d She asked the question innocently: it occurred to her as a wandering thought that possibly something might be saved from the wreck. Mrs. Cathcart shot a swift glance at her. Had that infernal Warrell been communicating with", "her? She knew that Warrell was a friend of Edith\u2019s husband. It would be iniquitous of him if he had. \u201cSome compensation was offered,\u201d she answered carelessly, \u201cquite inadequate; the matter is not settled yet, but I will let you know how it develops.\u201d \u201cWhat compensation do they offer?\u201d asked Edith. Mrs. Cathcart hesitated. \u201cA thousand pounds,\u201d she said reluctantly. \u201cA thousand pounds!\u201d The girl was startled, she had no idea the necklace was of that value. \u201cThat means, of course,\u201d Mrs. Cathcart hastened to explain, \u201cseven hundred pounds out of my pocket and three hundred pounds from the broker.\u201d The girl smiled inwardly. \u201cSeven hundred pounds from my pocket\u201d meant, \u201cif you ask for the full value you will rob me.\u201d \u201cAnd there is three hundred pounds due. I think I had better have that.\u201d \u201cWait a little,\u201d said Mrs. Cathcart, \u201cthey may recover the necklace, anyway; they want me to give a description of it. What do you think?\u201d The girl shook her head. \u201cI do not think I should like that,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cQuestions might be asked, and I should not like people to know either that the necklace was mine, or that my mother had deposited it as security against her debts.\u201d Here was the new Edith with a vengeance. Mrs. Cathcart stared at her. \u201cEdith,\u201d she said severely, \u201cthat sounds a little impertinent.\u201d \u201cI dare say it does, mother,\u201d said the girl, \u201cbut what am I to do? What am I to say? There are the facts fairly apparent to you and to me; the necklace is stolen, and it may possibly never be recovered, and I am not going to expose either my loss or your weakness on the remote possibility of getting back an article of jewellery which probably by this time is in the melting-pot and the stones dispersed.\u201d \u201cYou know a great deal about jewels and jewel-robbers,\u201d said her mother with a little sneer. \u201cHas Gilbert been enlarging your education?\u201d \u201cCuriously enough, he has,\u201d said her daughter calmly; \u201cwe discuss many queer things.\u201d \u201cYou must have very pleasant evenings,\u201d said the elder woman dryly. She rose to go, looking at her watch. \u201cI am sorry I cannot stay,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I am dining with some people. I suppose you would not like to come along? It is quite an informal affair; as a matter of fact, the invitation included you.\u201d \u201cAnd Gilbert?\u201d asked the girl. The woman smiled. \u201cNo, it did not exactly include Gilbert,\u201d she said. \u201cI have made it pretty clear that invitations to me are acceptable only so long as the party does not include your husband.\u201d The girl drew herself up stiffly, and the elder woman saw a storm gathering in her eyes. \u201cI do not quite understand you. Do you mean that you have gone round London talking unkindly about my husband?\u201d \u201cOf course I have,\u201d said Mrs. Cathcart virtuously. \u201cI do not know about having gone round London, but I have told those", "people who are intimate friends of mine, and who are naturally interested in my affairs.\u201d \u201cYou have no right to speak,\u201d said the girl angrily, \u201cit is disgraceful of you. You have made your mistake, and you must abide by the consequence. I also have made a mistake, and I cheerfully accept my lot. If it hurts you that I am married to a man who despises me, how much more do you think it hurts me?\u201d Mrs. Cathcart laughed. \u201cI assure you,\u201d she smiled, \u201cthat though many thoughts disturb my nights, the thought that your husband has no particular love for you is not one of them; what does wake me up with a horrid feeling is the knowledge that so far from being the rich man I thought he was, he is practically penniless. What madness induced him to give up his work at the Foreign Office?\u201d \u201cYou had better ask him,\u201d said the girl with malice, \u201che will be in in a few moments.\u201d It needed only this to hasten Mrs. Cathcart\u2019s departure, and Edith was left alone. * * * * Edith dined alone that night. At first she had welcomed with a sense of infinite relief these solitary dinners. She was a woman of considerable intelligence, and she had faced the future without illusion. She realised that there might come a time when she and Gilbert would live together in perfect harmony, though without the essential sympathies which husband and wife should mutually possess. She was willing to undergo the years of probation, and it made it all the easier for her if business or pleasure kept them apart during the embarrassing hours between dinner and bed-time. But to-night, for the first time, she was lonely. She felt the need of him, the desire for his society, the cheer and the vitality of him. There were moments when he was bright and happy and flippant, as she had known him at his best. There were other moments too, terrible and depressing moments, when she never saw him, when he shut himself in his study and she only caught a glimpse of his face by accident. She went through her dinner alternately reading and thinking. A book lay upon the table by her side, but she did not turn one page. The maid was clearing the entr\u00e9e when Edith Standerton looked up with a start. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat, madam?\u201d asked the girl. Outside the window Edith could hear the sound of music, a gentle, soft cadence of sound, a tiny wail of melodious tragedy. She rose from the table, walked across to the window and pulled aside the blinds. Outside a girl was playing a violin. In the light which a street lamp afforded Edith recognised the player of the \u201cMelody in F.\u201d CHAPTER IX. EDITH MEETS THE PLAYER Edith turned to her waiting maid. \u201cGo out and bring the girl in at once,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cWhich girl, madam?\u201d asked the startled", "servant. \u201cThe girl who is playing,\u201d said Edith. \u201cHurry please, before she goes.\u201d She was filled with sudden determination to unravel this mystery. She might be acting disloyally to her husband, but she adjusted any fear she may have had on the score with the thought that she might also be helping him. The maid returned in a few minutes and ushered in a girl. Yes, it was the girl she had seen on her wedding night. She stood now, framed in the doorway, watching her hostess with frank curiosity. \u201cWon\u2019t you come in?\u201d said Edith. \u201cHave you had any dinner?\u201d \u201cThank you very much,\u201d said the girl, \u201cwe do not take dinner, but I had a very good tea.\u201d \u201cWill you sit down for a little while?\u201d With a graceful inclination of her head the girl accepted the invitation. Her voice was free from the foreign accent which Edith had expected. She was indubitably English, and there was a refinement in her tone which Edith had not expected to meet. \u201cI suppose you wonder why I have sent for you?\u201d asked Edith Standerton. The girl showed two rows of white, even teeth in a smile. \u201cWhen people send for me,\u201d she said demurely, \u201cit is either to pay me for my music, or to bribe me to desist!\u201d There was frank merriment in her eyes, her smile lit up the face and changed its whole aspect. \u201cI am doing both,\u201d said Edith, \u201cand I also want to ask you something. Do you know my husband?\u201d \u201cMr. Standerton,\u201d said the girl, and nodded. \u201cYes, I have seen him, and I have played to him.\u201d \u201cDo you remember a night in June,\u201d asked Edith, her heart beating faster at the memory, \u201cwhen you came under this window and played\u201d--she hesitated--\u201ca certain tune?\u201d The girl nodded. \u201cWhy, yes,\u201d she said in surprise, \u201cof course I remember that night of all nights.\u201d \u201cWhy of all nights?\u201d asked Edith quickly. \u201cWell, you see as a rule my grandfather plays for Mr. Standerton, and that night he was ill. He caught a bad chill on Derby Day,--we were wet through by the storm, for we were playing at Epsom--and I had to come here and deputise for him. I did not want to go out a bit that night,\u201d she confessed with a bitter laugh, \u201cand I hate the tune; but it was all so mysterious and so romantic.\u201d \u201cJust tell me what was \u2018mysterious\u2019 and what was \u2018romantic,\u2019\u201d said Edith. The coffee came in at that moment, and she poured a cup for her visitor. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d she asked. \u201cMay Wing,\u201d said the girl. \u201cNow tell me, May, all you know,\u201d said Edith, as she passed the coffee, \u201cand please believe it is not out of curiosity that I ask you.\u201d \u201cI will tell you everything,\u201d said the girl, nodding. \u201cI remember that day particularly because I had been to the Academy of Music to take my lesson--you would not think we", "could afford that, but granny absolutely insists upon it. I got back home rather tired. Grandfather was lying down on the couch. We live at Hoxton. He seemed a little troubled. \u2018May,\u2019 he said, \u2018I want you to do something for me to-night.\u2019 Of course, I was quite willing and happy to do it.\u201d The girl stopped suddenly. \u201cWhy, how extraordinary,\u201d she said, \u201cI believe I have got proof in my pocket of all that I say.\u201d She had hanging from her waist a little bag of the same material as her dress, and this she opened and searched inside. She brought out an envelope. \u201cI will not show you this yet,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I will tell you what happened. Grandfather, as I was saying, was very troubled, and he asked me if I would do something for him, knowing of course that I would. \u201c\u2018I have had a letter which I cannot make head or tail of,\u2019 he said, and he showed me this letter.\u201d The girl held out the envelope. Edith took it and removed the card inside. \u201cWhy, this is my husband\u2019s writing!\u201d she cried. \u201cYes,\u201d nodded the girl. It bore the postmark of Doncaster, and the letter was brief. It was addressed to the old musician, and ran:-- \u201cEnclosed you will find a postal order for one pound. On receipt of this go to the house of Mr. Standerton between the hours of half-past seven and eight o\u2019clock and play Rubenstein\u2019s \u2018Melody in F.\u2019 Ascertain if he is at home, and if he is not return the next night and play the same tune at the same hour.\u201d That was all. \u201cI cannot understand it,\u201d said Edith, puzzled. \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d The girl musician smiled. \u201cI should like to know what it meant too. You see, I am as curious as you, and think it is a failing which all women share.\u201d \u201cAnd you do not know why this was sent?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cOr what is its meaning?\u201d Again the girl shook her head. Edith looked at the envelope and examined the postmark. It was dated May the twenty-fourth. \u201cMay the twenty- fourth,\u201d she repeated to herself. \u201cJust wait one moment,\u201d she said, and ran upstairs to her bedroom. Feverishly she unlocked her bureau and took out the red-covered diary in which she had inscribed the little events of her life in Portland Square. She turned to May the twenty-fourth. There were only two entries. The first had to do with the arrival of a new dress but the second was very emphatic:-- \u201cG. S. came at seven o\u2019clock and stayed to dinner. Was very absent-minded and worried apparently. He left at ten. Had a depressing evening.\u201d She looked at the envelope again. \u201cDoncaster, 7.30,\u201d it said. So the letter had been posted a hundred and eighty miles away half an hour after he had arrived in Portland Square. She went back to the dining-room bewildered, but she controlled her agitation in the presence of", "the girl. \u201cI must really patronise one of the arts,\u201d she smiled. She took a half-sovereign from her purse and handed it to May. \u201cOh, really,\u201d protested the little musician. \u201cNo, take it, please. You have given me a great deal to think about. Has Mr. Standerton ever referred to this incident since?\u201d \u201cNever,\u201d said the girl. \u201cI have never seen him since except once when I was on the top of an omnibus.\u201d A few minutes later the girl left. Here was food for imagination, sufficient to occupy her mind, thought Edith. \u201cWhat did it mean?\u201d she asked, \u201cwhat mystery was behind all this?\u201d Now that she recalled the circumstances, she remembered that Gilbert had been terribly distrait that night; he was nervous, she had noticed his hand shaking, and had remarked to her mother upon his extraordinary absent-mindedness. And if he had expected the musician to call, and if he himself had specified what tune should be played, why had its playing produced so terrible an effect upon him? He was no poseur. There was nothing theatrical in his temperament. He was a musician, and loved music as he loved nothing else in the world save her! She thought of that reservation with some tenderness. He had loved her then, whatever might be his feelings now, and the love of a strong man does not easily evaporate, nor is it destroyed at a word. Since their marriage his piano had not been opened. He had been a subscriber to almost every musical event in London, yet he had not attended a single concert, not once visited the opera. With the playing of the \u201cMelody in F\u201d it seemed to her there had ended one precious period of his life. She had suggested once that they should go to a concert which all musical London was attending. \u201cPerhaps you would like to go,\u201d he had suggested briefly. \u201cI am afraid I shall be rather busy that night.\u201d This, after he had told her not once, but a score of times that music expressed to him every message and every emotion in language clearer than the printed word. What did it mean? She was seized with a sudden energy, a sudden desire for knowledge--she wanted to share a greater portion of his life. What connection had this melody with the sudden change that had come to him? What association had it with the adoption of this strenuous life of his lately? What had it to do with his resignation from the Foreign Office and from his clubs? She was certain there must be some connection, and she was determined to discover what. As she was in the dark she could not help him. She knew instinctively that to ask him would be of little use. He was of the type who preferred to play a lone hand. She was his wife, she owed him something. She had brought unhappiness into his life, and she could do no less than strive", "to help him. She would want money. She sat down and wrote a little note to her mother. She would take the three hundred pounds which were due from the broker; she even went so far as to hint that if this matter were not promptly settled by her parent she herself would see Mr. Warrell and conclude negotiations. She had read in the morning paper the advertisement of a private detective agency, and for a while she was inclined to engage a man. But what special qualifications did private detectives have that she herself did not possess? It required no special training to use one\u2019s brains and to exercise one\u2019s logical faculties. She had found a mission in life--the solution of this mystery which surrounded her husband like a cloud. She found herself feeling cheerful at the prospect of the work to which she had set her hand. \u201cYou should find yourself an occupation,\u201d Gilbert had said in his hesitating fashion. She smiled, and wondered exactly what he would think if he knew the occupation she had found. * * * * The little house in Hoxton which sheltered May and her grandfather was in a respectable little street in the main inhabited by the members of the artisan class. Small and humble as the dwelling was it was furnished in perfect taste. The furniture was old in the more valuable and more attractive sense of the word. Old man Wing propped up in his arm-chair sat by a small fire in the room which served as kitchen and dining-room. May was busy with her sewing. \u201cMy dear,\u201d said the old man in his gentle voice. \u201cI do not think you had better go out again to-night.\u201d \u201cWhy not, grandpa?\u201d asked the girl without looking up from her work. \u201cWell, it is probably selfishness on my part,\u201d he said, \u201cbut somehow I do not want to be left alone. I am expecting a visitor.\u201d \u201cA visitor!\u201d Visitors were unusual at No. 9 Pexton Street, Hoxton. The only visitor they knew was the rent man who called with monotonous regularity every Monday morning. \u201cYes,\u201d said her grandfather hesitatingly, \u201cI think you remember the gentleman; you saw him some time ago.\u201d \u201cNot Mr. Standerton?\u201d The old man shook his head. \u201cNo, not Mr. Standerton,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you will recall how at Epsom a rather nice man helped you out of a crowd after a race?\u201d \u201cI remember,\u201d she said. \u201cHis name is Wallis,\u201d said the old man, \u201cand I met him by accident to- day when I was shopping.\u201d \u201cWallis,\u201d she repeated. Old Wing was silent for a while, then he asked-- \u201cDo you think, my dear, we could take a lodger?\u201d \u201cOh, no,\u201d protested the girl. \u201cPlease not!\u201d \u201cI find the rent rather heavy,\u201d said her grandfather, shaking his head, \u201cand this Mr. Wallis is a quiet sort of person and not likely to give us any trouble.\u201d Still the girl was not satisfied. \u201cI would rather we didn\u2019t,\u201d", "she said. \u201cI am quite sure we can earn enough to keep the house going without that kind of assistance. Lodgers are nuisances. I do not suppose Mrs. Gamage would like it.\u201d Mrs. Gamage was the faded neighbour who came in every morning to help straighten the house. The girl saw the old man\u2019s face fall and went round to him, putting her arm around his shoulder. \u201cDo not bother, grandpa dear,\u201d she said, \u201cif you want a lodger you shall have one. I think it would be rather nice to have somebody in the house who could talk to you when I am out.\u201d There was a knock at the door. \u201cThat must be our visitor,\u201d she said, and went to open it. She recognised the man who stood in the doorway. \u201cMay I come in?\u201d he asked. \u201cI wanted to see your grandfather on a matter of business. I suppose you are Miss Wing.\u201d She nodded. \u201cCome in,\u201d she said, and led the way to the kitchen. \u201cI will not keep you very long,\u201d said Mr. Wallis. \u201cNo, thank you, I will stand while I am here. I want to find a quiet lodging for a friend of mine. At least,\u201d he went on, \u201che is a man in whom I am rather interested, a very quiet sobersides individual who will be out most of the day, and possibly out most of the night too.\u201d He smiled. \u201cHe is a----\u201d He hesitated. \u201cHe is a taxi-cab driver, to be exact,\u201d he said, \u201cthough he does not want this fact to be well known because he has seen--er--better days.\u201d \u201cWe have only a very small room we can give your friend,\u201d said May, \u201cperhaps you would like to see it.\u201d She took him up to the spare bedroom which they had used on very rare occasions for the accommodation of the few visitors who had been their guests. The room was neat and clean, and George Wallis nodded approvingly. \u201cI should like nothing better than this for myself,\u201d he said. He himself suggested a higher price than she asked, and insisted upon paying a month in advance. \u201cI have told the man to call, he ought to be here by now; if you do not mind, I will wait for him.\u201d It was not a long wait, for in a few minutes there arrived the new lodger. He was a burly man with a heavy black beard, clipped short, and the fact that he was somewhat taciturn and short of speech rather enhanced his value as a lodger than otherwise. Wallis took farewell of the old man and his grand-daughter, and accompanied by the man, whose name was given somewhat unpromisingly as Smith, he walked to the end of the street. He had something to say, and that something was important. \u201cI have got you this place, Smithy,\u201d he said, as they walked slowly towards Hoxton High Street, \u201cbecause it is quiet and fairly safe. The people are respected,", "and nobody will bother you.\u201d \u201cThey are not likely to worry me in any way, are they?\u201d said the man addressed as Smith. \u201cNot at present,\u201d replied the other, \u201cbut I do not know exactly how things are going to develop. I am worried.\u201d \u201cWhat are you worried about?\u201d George Wallis laughed a little helplessly. \u201cWhy do you ask such stupid questions?\u201d he said with good-natured irritation. \u201cDon\u2019t you realise what has happened? Somebody knows our game.\u201d \u201cWell, why not drop it?\u201d asked the other quietly. \u201cHow can we drop it? My dear good chap, though in twelve months we have accumulated a store of movable property sufficiently valuable to enable us all to retire upon, there is not one of us who is willing at this moment to cut out--it would take us twelve months to get rid of the loot,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cI do not exactly know where it is,\u201d said Smith with a little smile. \u201cNobody knows that but me,\u201d replied Wallis with a little frown, \u201cthat is the worrying part of it. I feel the whole responsibility upon me. Smithy, we are being really watched.\u201d The other smiled. \u201cThat isn\u2019t unusual,\u201d he said. But Wallis was very serious. \u201cWhom do you suspect?\u201d he asked. The other did not answer for a moment. \u201cI do not suspect, I know,\u201d he said. \u201cA few months ago, when Calli and I were doing a job in Hatton Garden we were interrupted by the arrival of a mysterious gentleman, who watched me open the safe and disappeared immediately afterwards. At that time he did not seem to be particularly hostile or have any ulterior motive in view. Now, for some reason which is best known to himself, he is working against us. That is the man we have got to find.\u201d \u201cBut how?\u201d \u201cPut an advertisement in the paper,\u201d said the other sarcastically: \u201cWill the gentleman who dogs Mr. Wallis kindly reveal his identity, and no further action will be taken.\u201d \u201cBut seriously!\u201d said the other. \u201cWe have got to discover who he is, there must be some way of trapping him; but the only thing to do, and I must do it for my own protection, is to get you all together and share out. We had better meet.\u201d Smith nodded. \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cTo-night,\u201d said Wallis. \u201cMeet me at the.\u2026\u201d He mentioned the name of a restaurant near Regent Street. It was, curiously enough, the very restaurant where Gilbert Standerton invariably dined alone. CHAPTER X. THE NECKLACE Mrs. Cathcart was considerably surprised to receive an invitation to the dinner. She had that morning sent her daughter a cheque for three hundred pounds which she had received from her broker, but as their letters had crossed, one event had no connection with the other. She did not immediately decide to accept the invitation, she was not sure as to the terms on which she desired to remain with her new son-in-law. She was, however (whatever might be her faults), a", "good strategist, and there was nothing to be gained by declining the invitation, and there might be some advantage in accepting. She was surprised to meet Mr. Warrell, surprised and a little embarrassed; but now that her daughter knew everything there was no reason in the world why she should feel uncomfortable. She took him in charge, as was her wont, from the moment she met him in the little drawing-room at the St. John\u2019s Wood house. It was a pleasant dinner. Gilbert made a perfect host, he seemed to have revived within himself something of the old gay spirit. Warrell, remembering all that Mrs. Cathcart had told him, was on the qui vive to discover some evidence of dissension between husband and wife, the more anxious, perhaps, since he was before everything a professional man, to find justification for Mrs. Cathcart\u2019s suggestion, that all was not going well with Gilbert. Leslie Frankfort, a member of the party, had been questioned by his partner without the elder man eliciting any information which might help to dispel the doubt that was in Warrell\u2019s mind. Leslie Frankfort, that cheerful youth, was as much in the dark as his partner. It gave him some satisfaction to discover that at any rate there was no immediate prospect of ruin in his friend\u2019s m\u00e9nage. The dinner was perfect, the food rare and chosen by an epicure, which indeed it was, as Gilbert had assisted his wife to prepare the menu. The talk drifted idly, as talk does, at such a dinner party, around the topics which men and women were discussing at a thousand other dinner tables in England, and in the natural course of events it turned upon the startling series of burglaries that had been committed recently in London. That the talk should take this drift was more natural, perhaps, because Mrs. Cathcart had very boldly introduced the subject with reference to the burglary at Warrell\u2019s. \u201cNo, indeed,\u201d said Mr. Warrell, shaking his head, \u201cI regret to say we have no clue. The police have the matter in hand, but I\u2019m afraid we shall never find the man, or men, who perpetrated the crime.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t suppose they would be of much service to you if you found them,\u201d said Gilbert quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d demurred the other. \u201cWe might possibly get the jewels back.\u201d Gilbert Standerton laughed, but stopped in the middle of it. \u201cJewels?\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember, Gilbert?\u201d Leslie broke in. \u201cI told you that we had a necklace in the safe, the property of a client, one of those gambling ladies who patronise us.\u201d A warning glance from his partner arrested him. The gambling lady herself was rather red, and shot a malevolent glance at the indiscreet young man. \u201cThe necklace was mine,\u201d she said acidly. \u201cOh!\u201d said Leslie, and found the conversation of no great interest to him. Gilbert did not smile at his friend\u2019s embarrassment. \u201cA necklace,\u201d he repeated, \u201chow curious--yours?\u201d \u201cMine,\u201d repeated Mrs. Cathcart. \u201cI", "placed it with Warrell\u2019s for security. Precious fine security it proved,\u201d she added. Warrell was all apologies. He was embarrassed for more reasons than one. He was very annoyed indeed with the indiscreet youth who owed his preponderant interest in the firm the more by reason of his dead father\u2019s shares in the business than to any extent to his intelligence or his usefulness. \u201cExactly what kind of necklace was it?\u201d continued Gilbert. \u201cI did not see a description.\u201d \u201cNo description was given,\u201d said Mr. Warrell, coming to the relief of his client, whom he knew from infallible signs was fast losing her temper. \u201cWe wished to keep the matter quiet, so that it should not get into the papers.\u201d Edith tactfully turned the conversation, and in a few minutes they were deep in the discussion of a question which has never failed to excite great interest-- the abstract problem of the church. Mrs. Cathcart, it may be remarked in passing, was a churchwoman of some standing, a leader amongst a certain set, and an extreme ritualist. Add to this element the broad Nonconformity of Mr. Warrell, the frank scepticism of Leslie, and there were all the ingredients for an argument, which in less refined circles might develop to a sanguinary conclusion. Edith at least was relieved, however drastic the remedy might be, and was quite prepared to disestablish the Church of Wales, or if necessary the Church of England, rather than see the folly of her mother exposed. Despite argument, dogmatism of Mrs. Cathcart, philippic of Leslie, and the good-natured tolerance of Mr. Warrell, this latter a most trying attitude to combat, the dinner ended pleasantly, and they adjourned to the little drawing-room upstairs. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I shall have to leave you,\u201d said Gilbert. It was nearly ten o\u2019clock, and he had already warned his wife of an engagement he had made for a later hour. \u201cI believe old Gilbert is a journalist in these days,\u201d said Leslie. \u201cI saw you the other night in Fleet Street, didn\u2019t I?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied Gilbert shortly. \u201cThen it must have been your double,\u201d said the other. Edith had not followed the party upstairs. Just before dinner Gilbert had asked her, with some hesitation, to make him up a packet of sandwiches. \u201cI may be out the greater part of the night,\u201d he said. \u201cA man wants me to motor down to Brighton to meet somebody.\u201d \u201cWill you be out all night?\u201d she had asked, a little alarmed. He shook his head. \u201cNo, I shall be back by four,\u201d he said. She might have thought it was an unusual hour to meet people, but she made no comment. As her little party had gone upstairs she had remembered the sandwiches, and went down into the kitchen to see if cook had cut and laid them ready. She wrapped them up for him and packed them into a little flat sandwich case she had, and then made her way back to the hall. His", "coat was hanging on a rack, and she had to slip them into the pocket. There was a newspaper in the way; she pulled it out, and there was something else, something loose and uneven. She smiled at his untidiness, and put in her hand to remove the debris. Her face changed. What was it? Her fingers closed round the object in the bottom of the pocket, and she drew it out. There in the palm of her hand, clearly revealed by the electric lamp above her head, shone her diamond necklace! For a moment the little hall swayed, but she steadied herself with an effort. Her necklace! There was no doubt--she turned it over with trembling fingers. How had he got it? Where did it come from? A thought had struck her, but it was too horrible for her to give it expression. Gilbert a burglar! It was absurd. She tried to smile, but failed. Almost every night he had been out, every night in the week in which this burglary had been committed. She heard a footstep on the stairs, and thrust the necklace into the bosom of her dress. It was Gilbert. He did not notice her face, then-- \u201cGilbert,\u201d she said, and something in her voice warned him. He turned, peering down at her. \u201cWhat is wrong?\u201d he asked. \u201cWill you come into the dining-room for a moment?\u201d she said. Her voice sounded far away to her. She felt it was not she who was speaking, but some third person. He opened the door of the dining-room and walked in. The table was spread with the debris of the dinner which had just been concluded. The rosy glow of the overhead lamp fell upon a pretty chaos of flowers and silver and glass. He closed the door behind him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis,\u201d she replied quietly, and drew the necklace from her dress. He looked at it. Not a muscle of his face moved. \u201cThat?\u201d he said. \u201cWell, what is that?\u201d \u201cMy necklace!\u201d \u201cYour necklace,\u201d he repeated dully. \u201cIs that the necklace that your mother lost?\u201d She nodded, not trusting herself to speak. \u201cHow very curious.\u201d He reached out his hand and took it from her and examined the diamond pendant. \u201cAnd that is your necklace,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, that is a remarkable coincidence.\u201d \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d she asked. He did not make any reply. He was looking at her with a stony stare in which there was neither expression nor encouragement for speculation. \u201cWhere did I get it?\u201d he repeated calmly. \u201cWho told you that I\u2019d got it?\u201d \u201cI found it in your pocket,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cOh, Gilbert, there is no use denying that you had it there or you knew it was there. Where did you get it?\u201d Another pause, then came the answer-- \u201cI found it.\u201d It was lame and unconvincing, and he knew it. She repeated the question. \u201cI am not prepared to tell you,\u201d he said", "calmly. \u201cYou think I stole it, I suppose? You probably imagine that I am a burglar?\u201d He smiled, but the lips that curved in laughter were hard. \u201cI can see that in your eyes,\u201d he went on. \u201cYou explain my absence from home, my retirement from the Foreign Office, by the fact that I have taken up a more lucrative profession.\u201d He laughed aloud. \u201cWell, I have,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not exactly burglary. I assure you,\u201d he went on with mock solemnity, \u201cthat I have never burgled a safe in my life. I give you my word of honour that I have never stolen a single article of any----\u201d He stopped himself --he might say too much. But Edith grasped at the straw he offered her. \u201cOh, you do mean that, don\u2019t you?\u201d she said eagerly, and laid her two hands on his breast. \u201cYou really mean it? I know it is stupid of me, foolish and horribly disloyal--common of me, anything you like, to suspect you of so awful a thing, but it did seem--it did, didn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cIt did,\u201d he agreed gravely. \u201cWon\u2019t you tell me how it came into your possession?\u201d she pleaded. \u201cI tell you I found it-- that is true. I had no intention----\u201d He stopped again. \u201cIt was--I picked it up in the road, in a country lane.\u201d \u201cBut weren\u2019t you awfully surprised to find it, and didn\u2019t you tell the police?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cI was not surprised, and I did not tell the police. I intended restoring it, because, after all, jewels are of no value to me, are they?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand you, Gilbert.\u201d She shook her head, a little bewildered. \u201cNothing is of any use except what belongs to you, is it?\u201d \u201cThat depends,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cBut in this particular case I assure you that I brought this home to-night with the intention of putting it into a small box and addressing it to the Chief Commissioner of Police. You may believe that or not. That is why I thought it so extraordinary when you were talking at dinner that your mother should have lost a necklace, and that I should have found one.\u201d They stood looking at one another, he weighing the necklace on the palm of his hand, tossing it up and down mechanically. \u201cWhat are we going to do with it now?\u201d she asked. She was in a quandary. \u201cI hardly know how to advise.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cSuppose you carry out your present intention and send it to the police. \u201cOh!\u201d she remembered with a little move of dismay, \u201cI have practically stolen three hundred pounds.\u201d \u201cThree hundred pounds!\u201d He looked at the jewel. \u201cIt\u2019s worth more than three hundred pounds.\u201d In a few words she explained how the jewel came to be lost, and how it came to be deposited in the hands of Warrell\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that your mother is the culprit. I was afraid you\u2019d been", "gambling.\u201d \u201cWould that worry you?\u201d she asked quickly. \u201cA little,\u201d he said; \u201cit\u2019s enough for one member of a family to gamble.\u201d \u201cDo you gamble very much, Gilbert?\u201d she asked seriously. \u201cA little,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a little,\u201d she corrected. \u201cStock Exchange business is gambling.\u201d \u201cI am trying to make money for you,\u201d he said brusquely. It was the most brutal thing he had said to her in her short period of married life, and he saw he had hurt her. \u201cI am sorry,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI know I am a brute, but I did not mean to hurt you. I was just protesting in my heart against the unfairness of things. Will you take this, or shall I?\u201d \u201cI will take it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut won\u2019t you tell the police where you found it? Possibly they might find the proceeds of other robberies near by.\u201d \u201cI think not,\u201d he replied with a little smile. \u201cI have no desire to incur the anger of this particular gang. I am satisfied in my mind that it is one of the most powerful and one of the most unscrupulous in existence. It is nearly half-past ten,\u201d he said; \u201cI must fly.\u201d He held out his hand, and she took it. She held it for a moment longer than was her wont. \u201cGood-bye,\u201d she said. \u201cGood luck, whatever your business may be.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d he said. She went slowly back to her guests. It did not make the position any easier to understand. She believed her husband, and yet there was a certain reservation in what he had told her, a reservation which said as plainly as his guarded words could tell that there was much more he could have said had he been inclined. She did not doubt his word when he told her that he had never stolen from--from whom was he going to say? She was more determined than ever to solve this mystery, and after her guests had gone she was busily engaged in writing letters. She was hardly in bed that night before she heard his foot on the stairs and listened. He knocked at her door as he passed. \u201cGood-night,\u201d he said. \u201cGood-night,\u201d she replied. She heard his door close gently, and she waited for half an hour until she heard the click of his electric switch which told her that he was in bed, and that his light was extinguished. Then she stole softly out of bed, wrapped her dressing gown round her, and went softly down the stairs. Perhaps his coat was hanging in the hall. It was a wild, fantastic idea of hers that he might possibly have brought some further evidence that would help her in her search for the truth, but the pockets were empty. She felt something wet upon the sleeve, and gathered that it was raining. She went back to her room, closed the door noiselessly, and went to the window to look out into the street. It was", "a fine morning, and the streets were dry. She saw her hands. They were smeared with blood! She ran down the stairs again and turned on the light in the hall. Yes, there it was on his sleeve. There were little drops of blood on the stair carpet. She could trace him all the way up the stairs by this. She went straight to his room and knocked. He answered instantly. \u201cWho is that?\u201d \u201cIt is I. I want to see you.\u201d \u201cI am rather tired,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease let me in. I want to see you.\u201d She tried the door, but it was locked. Then she heard the bed creak as he moved. An instant later the bolt was slipped, and the light shone through the fanlight over the door. He was almost fully dressed, she observed. \u201cWhat is the matter with your arm?\u201d she asked. It was carefully bandaged. \u201cI hurt it. It is nothing very much.\u201d \u201cHow did you hurt it?\u201d she asked impatiently. She was nearing the end of her resources. She wanted him to say that it had happened in a taxi-cab smash or one of the street accidents to which city dwellers are liable, but he did not explain. She asked to see the wound. He was unwilling, but she insisted. At last he unwrapped the bandage, and showed an ugly little gash on the forearm. It was too rough to be the clean-cut wound of a knife or of broken glass. There was a second wound about the size of a sixpence near the elbow. \u201cThat looks like a bullet wound,\u201d she said, and pointed. \u201cIt has glanced along your arm, and has caught you again near the elbow.\u201d He did not speak. She procured warm water from the bathroom and bathed it, found a cool emollient in her room and dressed it as well as she could. She did not again refer to the circumstances under which the injury had been sustained. This was not the time nor the place to discuss that. \u201cThere is an excellent nurse spoilt in you,\u201d he said when she had finished. \u201cI am afraid there is an excellent man spoilt in you,\u201d she answered in a low voice, \u201cand I am rather inclined to think that I have done the spoiling.\u201d \u201cPlease get that out of your head altogether,\u201d he said almost roughly. \u201cA man is what he makes himself: you know the tag--the evil you do by two and two you answer for one by one; and even if you had any part in the influencing of my life for evil, I am firstly and lastly responsible.\u201d \u201cI am not so sure of that,\u201d said she. She had made him a little sling in which to rest his arm. \u201cYou married me because you loved me, because you gave to me all that a right-thinking woman would hold precious and sacred and because you expected me to give something in return. I have given you", "nothing. I humiliated you at the very outset by telling you why I had married you. You have the dubious satisfaction of knowing that I bear your name. You have, perhaps, half a suspicion that you live with one who is everlastingly critical of your actions and your intentions. Have I no responsibilities?\u201d There was a long silence, then she said-- \u201cWhatever you wish me to do I will always do.\u201d \u201cI wish you to be happy, that is all,\u201d he replied. His voice was of the same hard, metallic tone which she had noted before. She flushed a little. It had been an effort for her to say what she had, and he had rebuffed her. He was within his rights, she thought. She left him, and did not see him till the morning, when they met at breakfast. They exchanged a few words of greeting, and both turned their attention to their newspapers. Edith read hers in silence, read the one column which meant so much to her from end to end twice, then she laid the paper down. \u201cI see,\u201d she said, \u201cthat our burglars rifled the Bank of the Northern Provinces last night.\u201d \u201cSo I read,\u201d he said, without raising his eyes from his paper. \u201cAnd that one of them was shot by the armed guard of the bank.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve also seen that,\u201d said her husband. \u201cShot,\u201d she repeated, and looked at his bandaged arm. He nodded. \u201cI think my paper is a later edition than yours,\u201d he said gently. \u201cThe man that was shot was killed. They found his body in a taxi-cab. His name is not given, but I happen to know that it was a very pleasant florid gentleman named Persh. Poor fellow,\u201d he mused, \u201cit was poetic justice.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d she asked. \u201cHe did this,\u201d said Gilbert Standerton, and pointed to his arm with a grim smile. CHAPTER XI. THE FOURTH MAN On the night of Gilbert Standerton\u2019s little dinner party the black-bearded taxi driver, who had called at the house off Charing Cross Road for instructions, came to the door of No. 43, and was duly observed by the detective on duty. He went into the house, was absent five minutes, and came out again, driving off without a fare. Ten minutes later, at a signal from the detective, the house was visited by three C.I.D. men from Scotland Yard, and the mystery of the taxi-cab driver was cleared up for ever. For, instead of George Wallis, they discovered sitting at his ease in the drawing-room upstairs, and reading a novel with evident relish, that same black- bearded chauffeur. \u201cIt is very simple,\u201d said Inspector Goldberg, \u201cthe driver comes up and George Wallis is waiting inside made up exactly like him. The moment he enters the door and closes it Wallis opens it, and steps out on to the car and drives off. You people watching thought it was the same driver returned.\u201d He looked at his prisoner. \u201cWell, what are you", "going to do?\u201d asked the bearded man. \u201cI am afraid there is nothing we can do with you,\u201d said Goldberg regretfully. \u201cHave you got a licence?\u201d \u201cYou bet your life I have,\u201d said the driver cheerfully, and produced it. \u201cI can take you for consorting with criminals.\u201d \u201cA difficult charge to prove,\u201d said the bearded one, \u201cmore difficult to get a conviction on, and possibly it would absolutely spoil your chance of bagging George in the end.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said Goldberg; \u201canyway, I\u2019m going to look for your taxi-cab. I can at least pull George in for driving without a licence.\u201d The man shook his head. \u201cI am sorry to disappoint you,\u201d he said with mock regret, \u201cbut George has a licence too.\u201d \u201cThe devil he has,\u201d said the baffled inspector. \u201cFunny, isn\u2019t it,\u201d said the bearded man. \u201cGeorge is awfully thorough.\u201d \u201cCome now, Smith,\u201d said the detective genially, \u201cwhat is the game? How deep in this are you?\u201d \u201cIn what?\u201d asked the puzzled man. Goldberg gave him up for a bad job. He knew that Wallis had chosen his associates with considerable care. \u201cAnyway, I will go after George,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are probably putting up a little bluff on me about the licence. Once I get him inside the jug there are lots of little things I might be able to discover.\u201d \u201cDo,\u201d said the driver earnestly. \u201cYou will find him standing on the Haymarket rank at about half-past ten to-night.\u201d \u201cYes, I know,\u201d said the detective sardonically. He had no charge and no warrant, save the search warrant which gave him the right of entry. Smith, the driver, was sent about his business, and a detective put on to shadow him. With what success this shadowing was done may be gathered from the fact that at half-past ten that night Inspector Goldberg discovered the cab he was seeking, and to his amazement found it in the very place where Smith had told him to expect it. And there the bearded driver was sitting with all the aplomb of one who was nearing the end of a virtuous and well-rewarded day. \u201cNow, George,\u201d said the inspector jocularly, \u201ccome down off that perch and let me have a look at your licence; if it is not made out in your name I am going to pull you.\u201d The man did not descend, but he put his hand in his pocket and produced a little leather wallet. The inspector opened it and read. \u201cAh!\u201d he said exultantly, \u201cas I thought, this is made out in the name of Smith.\u201d \u201cI am Smith,\u201d said the driver calmly. \u201cGet down,\u201d said the inspector. The man obeyed. There was no question as to his identity. \u201cYou see,\u201d he explained, \u201cwhen you put your flat-footed splits on to follow me I had no intention of bothering George. He is big enough to look after himself, and, by the way, his licence is made out in his own name, so you need not trouble", "about that. \u201cBut as soon as I saw you did not trust me,\u201d he said reproachfully, \u201cwhy, I sort of got on my metal. I slipped your busy fellow in Oxford Street, and came on and took my cab from the desperate criminal you are chasing.\u201d \u201cWhere is he now?\u201d asked Goldberg. \u201cIn his flat, and in bed I trust at this hour,\u201d said the bearded man virtuously. With this the inspector had to be content. To make absolutely sure, he went back to the house off Charing Cross Road, and found, as he feared, Mr. George Wallis, if not in bed, at least in his dressing-gown, and the end of his silk pyjamas flapped over his great woollen slippers. \u201cMy dear good chap,\u201d he expostulated wearily, \u201cam I never to be left in quiet? Must the unfortunate record which I bear still pursue me, penitent as I am, and striving, as I may be, to lead that unoffending life which the State demands of its citizens?\u201d \u201cDo not make a song about it, George,\u201d grumbled Goldberg. \u201cYou have kept me busy all the night looking after you. Where have you been?\u201d \u201cI have been to a picture palace,\u201d said the calm man, \u201cobserving with sympathetic interest the struggles of a poor but honest bank clerk to secure the daughter of his rich and evil boss. I have been watching cow-boys shooting off their revolvers and sheriffs galloping madly across plains. I have, in fact, run through the whole gamut of emotions which the healthy picture palace excites.\u201d \u201cYou talk too much,\u201d said the inspector. He did not waste any further time, and left Mr. Wallis stifling a sleepy yawn; but the door had hardly closed behind the detective when Wallis\u2019s dressing-gown was thrown aside, his pyjamas and woollen slippers discarded, and in a few seconds the man was fully dressed. From the front window he saw the little knot of detectives discussing the matter, and watched them as they moved slowly to the end of the street. There would be a further discussion there, and then one of them would come back to his vigil; but before they had reached the end of the street he was out of the house and walking rapidly in the opposite direction to that which they had taken. He had left a light burning to encourage the watcher. He must take his chance about getting back again without being observed. He made his way quickly in the direction of the tube station, and a quarter of an hour later, by judicious transfers, he was in the vicinity of Hampstead. He walked down the hill towards Belsize Park and picked up a taxi-cab. He had stopped at the station to telephone, and had made three distinct calls. Soon after eleven he was met at Chalk Farm Station by his two confederates. Thereafter all trace was lost of them. So far, in a vague and unsatisfactory way, Inspector Goldberg had kept a record of Wallis\u2019s", "movements that night. He had to guess much, and to take something on trust, for the quarry had very cleverly covered his tracks. At midnight the guard in the Bank of the Northern Provinces was making his round, and was ascending the stone steps which led from the vault below, when three men sprang at him, gagged him and bound him with incredible swiftness. They did not make any attempt to injure him, but with scientific thoroughness they placed him in such a position that he was quite incapable of offering resistance or of summoning assistance to his aid. They locked him in a small room usually occupied by the assistant bank manager, and proceeded to their work downstairs. \u201cThis is going to be a stiff job,\u201d said Wallis, and he put his electric lamp over the steel grating which led to the entrance to the strong room. Persh, the stout man who was with him, nodded. \u201cThe grating is nothing,\u201d he said, \u201cI can get this open.\u201d \u201cLook for the bells, Callidino,\u201d said Wallis. The little Italian was an expert in the matter of alarms, and he examined the door scientifically. \u201cThere is nothing here,\u201d he said definitely. Persh, who was the best lock man in the world, set to work, and in a quarter of an hour the gate swung open. Beyond this, at the end of the passage, was a plain green door, offering no purchase whatever to any of the instruments they had brought. Moreover, the lock was a remarkable one, since it was not in the surface of the door itself, but in a small steel cabinet in the room overhead. But the blow-pipe was got to work expeditiously. Wallis had the plan of the door carefully drawn to scale, and he knew exactly where the vital spot in the massive steel covering was to be found. For an hour and a half they worked, then Persh stopped suddenly. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d he said. Without another word the three men raced back along the passage, up the stairs to the big office on the ground floor, Persh leading. As he made his appearance from the stairway a shot rang out, and he staggered. He thought he saw a figure moving in the shadow of the wall, and fired at it. \u201cYou fool!\u201d said Wallis, \u201cyou will have the whole place surrounded.\u201d Again a shot was fired, and this time there was no doubt as to who was the assailant. Wallis threw the powerful gleam of his lamp in the direction of the office. With one hand free and the other holding a revolver, there crouched near the door the guard they had left secure. Wallis doused his light as the man fired again. \u201cOut of this, quick!\u201d he cried. Through the back way they sped, up the little ladder then through the skylight where they had entered, across the narrow ledge, and through the hosier\u2019s establishment which had been the means of entrance. Persh was", "mortally wounded, though he made the supreme and final effort of his life. They saw people running in the direction of the Bank, and heard a police whistle blow; but they came out of the hosier\u2019s shop together, quietly and without fuss, three respectable gentlemen, one apparently a little the worse for drink. Wallis hailed a taxi-cab, and gave elaborate directions. He made no attempt to hurry whilst Callidino assisted the big man into the vehicle, then they drove off leisurely. As the cab moved Persh collapsed into one corner. \u201cWere you hit?\u201d asked Wallis anxiously. \u201cI am done for, George, I think,\u201d whispered the man. George made a careful examination with his lamp and gasped. He was leaning his head out of the window. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d asked Persh weakly. \u201cI am going to take you to the hospital,\u201d said Wallis. \u201cYou will do nothing of the kind,\u201d said the other hoarsely. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake do not jeopardise the whole crowd for me. I tell you I am finished. I can----\u201d He said no other word, every muscle in his frame seemed at that moment to relax, and he slid in a loose heap to the floor. They lifted him up. \u201cMy God!\u201d said Wallis, \u201che is dead.\u201d And dead, indeed, was Persh, that amiable and florid man. * * * * \u201cThe burglary at the Northern Provinces Bank continues to excite a great deal of comment in city circles,\u201d wrote the representative of the Daily Monitor. \u201cThe police have made a number of interesting discoveries. There can be no doubt whatever that the miscreants escaped by way of\u201d (here followed a fairly accurate description of the method of departure). \u201cWhat interests the police, however, is the evidence they are able to secure as to the presence of another man in the bank who is as yet unaccounted for. The fourth man seems to have taken no part in the robbery, and to have been present without the knowledge or without the goodwill of the burglars. The bank guard who was interviewed this morning by our representative, was naturally reticent in the interest of his employers, but he confirmed the rumour that the fourth man, whoever he was, was not antagonistic so far as he (the guard) was concerned. It now transpires that the guard had been hastily bound and gagged by the burglars, who probably, without any intention, had left their victim in some serious danger, as the gag had been fixed in such a manner that the unfortunate man nearly died. \u201cThen when he was almost in extremis there had appeared on the scene the fourth individual, who had loosened the gag, and made him more comfortable. It was obvious that he was not a member of the original burglar gang. \u201cThe theory is offered that on the night in question two separate and independent sets of burglars were operating against the bank. Whether that is so or not, a tribute must be paid to the", "humanity of number four.\u201d * * * * \u201cSo that was it.\u201d Wallis read the account in his paper that morning without resentment. Though the evening had ended disastrously for him, he had cause for satisfaction. \u201cI should never have forgiven myself if we had killed that guard,\u201d he said to his companion. His eyes were tired, and his face was unusually pale. He had spent a strenuous evening. He sat now in his bucket- shop office, and his sole companion was Callidino. \u201cI suppose poor old Persh will catch us,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy Persh?\u201d asked the other. \u201cThe taxi driver will be able to identify us as having been his companions. I wonder they have not come before. There is no use in running away. Do you know,\u201d he asked suddenly, \u201cthat no man ever escapes the English police if he is known. It saves a lot of trouble to await developments.\u201d \u201cI thought you had been to the station,\u201d said Callidino in surprise. \u201cI have,\u201d said Wallis, \u201cI went there the first thing--in fact, the moment I had an excuse--to identify Persh. There is no sense in pretending we did not know him. The only thing to do is to prove the necessary alibis. As for me, I was in bed and asleep.\u201d \u201cDid anybody see you get back?\u201d asked Callidino. Wallis shook his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cthey left one man to look after me, and he did a very natural thing, he walked up and down the street. There was nothing easier than to walk the way he was going behind his back and slip in just when I wanted to.\u201d Shadowing is a most tiring business, and what very few realise is the physical strain of remaining in one position, having one object in view. Even the trained police may be caught napping in the most simple manner, and as Wallis said, he had found no difficulty in making his way back to the house without observation. The only danger had been that during his absence somebody had called. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Callidino smiled. \u201cMy alibi is more complex,\u201d he said, \u201cand yet more simple. My excellent compatriots will swear for me. They lie very readily these Neapolitans.\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t you a Neapolitan?\u201d \u201cSicilian,\u201d smiled the other. \u201cNeapolitan!\u201d The contempt in his tone amused Wallis. \u201cWho is the fourth man?\u201d Callidino asked suddenly. \u201cOur mysterious stranger, I am certain of that,\u201d said George Wallis moodily. \u201cBut who the devil is he? I have never killed a man in my life so far, but I shall have to take unusual measures to settle my curiosity in this respect. \u201cThere will have to be a division of the loot,\u201d he said after a while, \u201cI will go into it to-day. Persh has relations somewhere in the world, a daughter or a sister, she must have her share. There is a fake solicitor in Southwark who will do the work for us. We shall have to invent an uncle", "who died.\u201d Callidino nodded. \u201cAs for me,\u201d he said, rising and stretching himself, \u201calready the vineyards of the South are appealing to me. I shall build me a villa in Montecatini and drink the wines, and another on Lake Maggiore and bathe in the waters. I shall do nothing for the rest of my life save eat and drink and bathe.\u201d \u201cA perfectly ghastly idea!\u201d said Wallis. The question of the fourth man troubled him more than he confessed. It was shaking his nerves. The police he understood, and was prepared for, could even combat, but here was the fourth man as cunning as they, who knew their plans, who followed them, who kept them under observation. Why? What object had he? He did not doubt that the fourth man was he who had watched them in Hatton Garden. If it was a hobby it was a most extraordinary hobby, and the man must be mad. If he had an object in view, why did he not come out into the daylight and admit it? \u201cI wonder how I can get hold of him?\u201d he said half aloud. \u201cAdvertise for him,\u201d said Callidino. A sharp retort rose to the other\u2019s lips, but he checked it. After all, there was something in that. One could do many things through the columns of the daily press. CHAPTER XII. THE PLACE WHERE THE LOOT WAS STORED \u201cWill the Hatton Garden intruder communicate with the man who lay on the floor, and arrange a meeting. The man on the floor has a proposition to make, and promises no harm to intruder.\u201d Gilbert Standerton read the advertisement when he was taking his breakfast, and a little smile gathered at the corners of his lips. Edith saw the smile. \u201cWhat is amusing you, Gilbert?\u201d she asked. \u201cA thought,\u201d he said. \u201cI think these advertisements are so funny.\u201d She had seen the direction of his eyes, carefully noted the page of the paper, and waited for an opportunity to examine for herself the cause of his amusement. \u201cBy the way,\u201d he said carelessly, \u201cI am putting some money to your credit at the bank to-day.\u201d \u201cMine?\u201d she asked. He nodded. \u201cYes, I have been rather fortunate on the Stock Exchange lately--I made twelve thousand pounds out of American rails.\u201d She looked at him steadily. \u201cDo you mean that?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat else could I mean?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou see, American rails have been rather jumpy of late, and so have I.\u201d He smiled again. \u201cI jumped in when they were low and jumped out when they were high. Here is the broker\u2019s statement.\u201d He drew it from his pocket and passed it across the table to her. \u201cI feel,\u201d he said, with a pretence of humour, \u201cthat you should know I do not secure my entire income from my nefarious profession.\u201d She made no response to this. She knew who the fourth man had been. Why had he gone there? What had been his object? If he", "had been a detective, or if he had been in the employ of the Government, he would have confessed it. Her heart had sunk when she had read the interesting theory which had been put forward by the journal. He was the second burglar. She thought all this with the paper he had passed to her on the table before her. The broker\u2019s statement was clear enough. Here were the amounts, all columns ruled and carried forward. \u201cYou will observe that I have not put it all to your credit,\u201d he bantered, \u201csome of it has gone to mine.\u201d \u201cGilbert,\u201d she asked, \u201cwhy do you keep things from me?\u201d \u201cWhat do I keep from you?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy do you keep from me the fact that you were in the bank the night before last when this horrible tragedy occurred?\u201d He did not answer immediately. \u201cI have not kept it from you,\u201d he said. \u201cI have practically admitted it--in an unguarded moment, I confess, but I did admit it.\u201d \u201cWhat were you doing there?\u201d she demanded. \u201cMaking my fortune,\u201d he said solemnly. But she was not to be put off by his flippancy. \u201cWhat were you doing there?\u201d she asked again. \u201cI was watching three interesting burglars at work,\u201d he said, \u201cas I have watched them not once but many times. You see, I am specially gifted in one respect. Nature intended me to be a burglar, but education and breed and a certain lawfulness of character prohibited that course. I am a dilettante: I do not commit crime, but I am monstrously interested in it. I seek,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cto discover what fascination crime has over the normal mind; also I have an especial reason for checking the amount these men collect.\u201d Her puzzled frown hurt him; he did not want to bother her, but she knew so much now that he must tell her more. He had thought it would have been possible to have hidden everything from her, but people cannot live together in the same house and be interested in one another\u2019s comings and goings without some of their cherished secrets being revealed. \u201cWhat I cannot understand----\u201d she said slowly and was at a loss for an introduction to this delicate subject. \u201cWhat cannot you understand?\u201d he asked. \u201cI cannot understand why you suddenly dropped all your normal pleasures, why you left the Foreign Office, why you gave up music, and why, above all things, that this change in your life should have come about immediately after the playing of the \u2018Melody in F.\u2019\u201d He was silent for a moment, and when he spoke his voice was low and troubled. \u201cYou are not exactly right,\u201d he said. \u201cI had begun my observations into the ways of the criminal before that tune was played.\u201d He paused. \u201cI admit that I had some fear in my mind that sooner or later the \u2018Melody in F\u2019 would be played under my window, and I was making a half-hearted", "preparation against the evil day. That is all I can tell you,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me this,\u201d she asked as he rose, \u201cif I had loved you, and had been all that you desired, would you have adopted this course?\u201d He thought awhile. \u201cI cannot tell you,\u201d he said at length; \u201cpossibly I should, perhaps I should not. Yes,\u201d he said, nodding his head, \u201cI should have done what I am doing now, only it would have been harder to do if you had loved me. As it is----\u201d he shrugged his shoulders. He went out soon after, and she found the paper he had been reading, and without difficulty discovered the advertisement. Then he was the Hatton Garden intruder, and what he had said was true. He had observed these people, and they had known they were being observed. With a whirling brain she sat down to piece together the threads of mystery. She was no nearer a solution when she had finished, from sheer exhaustion, than when she had begun. * * * * Gilbert had not intended spending the night away from his house. He realised that his wife would worry, and that she would have a genuine grievance; apart from which he was, in a sense, domesticated, and if the life he was living was an unusual one, it had its charm and its attraction. The knowledge that he would meet her every morning, speak to her during the day, and that he had in her a growing friend was particularly pleasing to him. He had gone to a little office that he rented over a shop in Cheapside, an office which his work in the City had made necessary. He unlocked the door of the tiny room, which was situated on the third floor, and entered, closing the door behind him. There were one or two letters which had come to him in the capacity in which he appeared as the tenant of the office. They were mainly business communications, and required little or no attention. He sat down at his desk to write a note; he thought he might be late that night, and wanted to explain his absence. His wife occupied a definite place in his life, and though she exercised no rights over his movements, yet could quite reasonably expect to be informed of his immediate plans. He had scarcely put pen to paper when a knock came to the door. \u201cCome in,\u201d said Gilbert in some surprise. It was not customary for people to call upon him here. He expected to see a wandering canvasser in search of an order, but the man that came in was nothing so commonplace. Gilbert knew him as a Mr. Wallis, an affable and a pleasant man. \u201cSit down, will you?\u201d he said, without a muscle of his face wrong. \u201cI want to see you, Mr. Standerton,\u201d said Wallis, and made no attempt to seat himself. \u201cWould you care to come to my office?\u201d \u201cI", "can see you here, I think,\u201d said Gilbert calmly. \u201cI prefer to see you in my office,\u201d said the man, \u201cwe are less liable to interruption. You are not afraid to come, I suppose?\u201d he said with the hint of a smile. \u201cI am not to be piqued into coming, at any rate,\u201d smiled Gilbert; \u201cbut since this is not a very expansive office, nor conducive to expansive thought, I will go with you. I presume you intend taking me into your confidence?\u201d He looked at the other man strangely and Wallis nodded. The two men left the office together, and Gilbert wondered exactly what proposition the other would put to him. Ten minutes later they were in the St. Bride Street store, that excellent Safe Agency whose business apparently was increasing by leaps and bounds. Gilbert Standerton looked round. The manager was there, a model of respectability. He bowed politely to Wallis, and was somewhat surprised to see him perhaps, for the proprietor of the St. Bride\u2019s Safe Agency was a rare visitor. \u201cMy office, I think?\u201d suggested Wallis. He closed the door behind them. \u201cNow exactly what do you want?\u201d asked Gilbert. \u201cWill you have a cigar?\u201d Mr. Wallis pushed the box towards him. Gilbert smiled. \u201cYou need not be scared of them,\u201d said Wallis with a twinkle in his eye. \u201cThere is nothing dopey or wrong with these, they are my own special brand.\u201d \u201cI do not smoke cigars,\u201d said Gilbert. \u201cLie number one,\u201d replied Wallis cheerfully. \u201cThis is a promising beginning to an exchange of confidences. Now, Mr. Standerton, we are going to be very frank with one another, at least I am going to be very frank with you. I hope you will reciprocate, because I think I deserve something. You know so much about me, and I know so little about you, that it would be fair if we evened matters up.\u201d \u201cI take you,\u201d said Gilbert, \u201cand if I can see any advantage in doing so you may be sure I shall act on your suggestion.\u201d \u201cA few months ago,\u201d said Mr. Wallis, puffing slowly at his cigar, and regarding the ceiling with an attentive eye, \u201cI and one of my friends were engaged in a scientific work.\u201d Gilbert nodded. \u201cIn the midst of that work we were interrupted by a gentleman, who for a reason best known to himself modestly hid his features behind a mask.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI deplore the melodrama, but I applaud the discretion. Since then,\u201d he went on, \u201cthe efforts of my friends in their scientific pursuit of wealth have been hampered and hindered by that same gentleman. Sometimes we have seen him, and sometimes we have only discovered his presence after we have retired from the scene of our labour. Now, Mr. Standerton, this young man may have excellent reasons for all he is doing, but he is considerably jeopardising our safety.\u201d \u201cWho is the young man?\u201d asked Gilbert Standerton. \u201cThe young man,\u201d said Mr.", "Wallis, without taking his eyes from the ceiling, \u201cis yourself.\u201d \u201cHow do you know?\u201d asked Gilbert quietly. \u201cI know,\u201d said the other with a smile, \u201cand there is an end to it. I can prove it curiously enough without having actually spotted your face.\u201d He pulled an inkpad from the end of the desk. \u201cWill you make a little finger-mark upon that sheet of paper?\u201d he asked, and offered a sheet of paper. Gilbert shook his head with a smile. \u201cI see no reason why I should,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cExactly. If you did we should find a very interesting finger-mark to compare with it. In the office here,\u201d Mr. Wallis went on, \u201cwe have a large safe which has been on our hands for some months.\u201d Gilbert nodded. \u201cOwned by a client who has the keys,\u201d he said. \u201cExactly,\u201d said Wallis. \u201cYou remember my lie about it. There are three sets of keys to that safe and a combination word. I said three\u201d--he corrected himself carefully--\u201cthere are really four. By an act of gross carelessness on my part, I left the keys of the safe in my pocket in this very office three weeks ago. \u201cI must confess,\u201d he said with a smile, \u201cthat I did not suspect you of having so complete a knowledge of my doings or of my many secrets. I remembered my folly at eleven o\u2019clock that night, and came back for what I had left behind. I found them exactly where I had left them, but somebody else had found them, too, and that somebody else had taken a wax impression of them. Moreover,\u201d he leant forward towards Gilbert, lowering his voice, \u201cthat somebody else has since formed the habit of coming to this place nightly for reasons of his own. Do you know what those reasons are, Mr. Standerton?\u201d \u201cTo choose a safe?\u201d suggested Gilbert ironically. \u201cHe comes to rob us of the fruits of our labour,\u201d said Wallis. He smiled as he said the words because he had a sense of humour. \u201cSome individual who has a conscience or a sense of rectitude which prevents him from becoming an official burglar is engaged in the fascinating pursuit of robbing the robber. In other words, some twenty thousand pounds in solid cash has been taken from my safe.\u201d \u201cBorrowed, I do not doubt,\u201d said Gilbert Standerton, and leant back in his chair, his hands stuffed into his pockets, and a hard look upon his face. \u201cWhat do you mean--borrowed?\u201d asked Wallis in surprise. \u201cBorrowed by somebody who is desperately in need of money; somebody who understands the Stock Exchange much better than many of the men who make a special study of it; somebody with such knowledge as would enable him to gamble heavily with a minimum chance of loss, and yet, despite this, fearing to injure some unfortunate broker by the accident of failure.\u201d He leant towards Wallis, his elbow upon the desk, his face half averted from the other. He had", "heard the outer door close with a bang, and knew they were alone now, and that Wallis had designed it so. \u201cI wanted money badly,\u201d he said. \u201cI could have stolen it easily. I intended stealing it. I watched you for a month. I have watched criminals for years. I know as many tricks of the trade as you. Remember that I was in the Foreign Office, in that department which had to do mainly with foreign crooks, and that I was virtually a police officer, though I had none of the authority.\u201d \u201cI know all about that,\u201d said Wallis. He was curious, he desired information for his own immediate use, he desired it, too, that his sum of knowledge concerning humanity should be enlarged. \u201cI am a thief--in effect. The reason does not concern you.\u201d \u201cHad the \u2018Melody in F\u2019 anything to do with it?\u201d asked the other dryly. Gilbert Standerton sprang to his feet. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked. \u201cJust what I say,\u201d said the other, watching him keenly. \u201cI understand that you had an eccentric desire to hear that melody played. Why? I must confess I am curious.\u201d \u201cReserve your curiosity for something which concerns you,\u201d said the other roughly. \u201cWhere did you learn?\u201d he added the question, and Wallis laughed. \u201cWe have sources of information----\u201d he began magniloquently. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d Gilbert nodded, \u201cof course, your friend Smith lodges with the Wings. I had forgotten that.\u201d \u201cMy friend Smith--you refer to my chauffeur, I suppose?\u201d \u201cI refer to your confederate, the fourth member of your gang, the man who never appears in any of your exploits, and who in various guises is laying down the foundation for robberies of the future. Oh, I know all about this place,\u201d he said. He waved his hand around the shop. \u201cI know this scheme of a Safe Agency; it is ingenious, but it is not original. I think it was done some years ago in Italy. You tout safes round to country mansions, offer them at ridiculous prices, and the rest is simple. You have the keys, and at any moment you can go into a house into which such a safe has been sold with the certain knowledge that all the valuables and all the portable property will be assembled in the one spot and accessible to you.\u201d Wallis nodded. \u201cQuite right, friend,\u201d he said. \u201cI need no information concerning myself. Will you kindly explain exactly what part you are taking? Are you under the impression that you are numbered amongst the honest?\u201d \u201cI do not,\u201d said the other shortly. \u201cThe morality of my actions has nothing whatever to do with the matter. I have no illusion.\u201d \u201cYou are a fortunate man,\u201d said George Wallis approvingly. \u201cBut will you please tell me what part you are playing, and how you justify your action in removing from time to time large sums of money from our possession to some secret depository of your own?\u201d \u201cI do not justify it,\u201d", "said Gilbert. He got up and paced the little office, the other watching him narrowly. \u201cI tell you I know that I am in intent a thief, but I am working to a plan.\u201d He turned to the other. \u201cDo you know that there is not a robbery you have committed of which I do not know the absolute effect? There is not a piece of jewellery you have taken of which I do not know the owner and the exact value? Yes,\u201d he nodded, \u201cI am aware that you have not \u2018fenced\u2019--that is the term, isn\u2019t it?--a single article, and that in your safe place you have them all stored. I hope by good fortune not only to compensate you for what I have taken from you, but to return every penny that you have stolen.\u201d Wallis started. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked. \u201cTo its rightful owner,\u201d continued Gilbert calmly. \u201cI have striven to be in a position to say to you: \u2018Here is a necklace belonging to Lady Dynshird, it is worth four thousand pounds, I will give you a fair price for it, let us say a thousand--it is rather more than you could sell it for--and we will restore it to its owner.\u2019 I want to say to you: \u2018I have taken ten thousand sovereigns in bullion and in French banknotes from your store, here is that amount for yourself, here is a similar amount which is to be restored to the people from whom it was taken.\u2019 I have kept a careful count of every penny you have taken since I joined your gang as an unofficial member.\u201d He smiled grimly. \u201cMy dear Quixote,\u201d drawled George Wallis protestingly, \u201cyou are setting yourself an impossible task.\u201d Gilbert Standerton shook his head. \u201cIndeed I am not,\u201d he said. \u201cI have made much more money on the Stock Exchange than ever I thought I should possess in my life.\u201d \u201cWill you tell me this?\u201d asked the other. \u201cWhat is the explanation of this sudden desire of yours for wealth--for sudden desire I gather it was?\u201d \u201cThat I cannot explain,\u201d said Gilbert, and his tone was uncompromising. There was a little pause, then George Wallis rose. \u201cI think we had better understand one another now,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have taken from us nearly twenty thousand pounds--twenty thousand pounds of our money swept out of existence.\u201d Gilbert shook his head. \u201cNo, there is not a penny of it gone. I tell you I used it as a reserve in case I should want it. As a matter of fact, I shall not want it now,\u201d he smiled, \u201cI could restore it to you to-night.\u201d \u201cYou will greatly oblige me if you do,\u201d said the other. Gilbert looked at him. \u201cI rather like you, Wallis,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is something admirable about you, rascal that you are.\u201d \u201cRascals as we are,\u201d corrected Wallis. \u201cYou who have no illusions do not create one now.\u201d \u201cI suppose that is so,\u201d said the", "other moodily. \u201cHow is this going to end?\u201d asked Wallis. \u201cWhere do we share out, and are you prepared to carry on this high-soul arrangement as long as my firm is in existence?\u201d Standerton shook his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cyour business ends to- night.\u201d \u201cMy business?\u201d asked the startled Wallis. \u201cYour business,\u201d said the other. \u201cYou have made enough money to retire on. Get out. I have made sufficient money to take over all your stock at valuation\u201d--he smiled again--\u201cand to restore every penny that has been stolen by you. I was coming to you in a few days with that proposition.\u201d \u201cAnd so we end to-night, do we?\u201d mused Wallis. \u201cMy dear good man,\u201d he said cheerfully, \u201cto-night--why I am going out after the most wonderful coup of all! You would laugh if you knew who was my intended victim.\u201d \u201cI am not easily amused in these days,\u201d said Gilbert. \u201cWho is it?\u201d \u201cI will tell you another time,\u201d said Wallis. He walked to the office door, his hands in his pockets. He stood for a moment admiring a huge safe and whistling a little tune. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it an excellent idea of mine,\u201d he asked with the casual air of the suburban householder showing off a new cucumber frame, \u201cthis safe?\u201d \u201cI think it is most excellent.\u201d \u201cBusiness is good,\u201d said Wallis regretfully. \u201cIt is a pity to give it up after we have taken so much trouble. You see, we may not sell half a dozen safes a year to the right kind of people, but if we only sell one-- why we pay expenses! It is so simple,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the way, have you missed a necklace of sorts which has been restored to the police? Do not apologise!\u201d He raised his hand. \u201cI understand this is a family matter. I am sorry to have caused you any inconvenience.\u201d His ironical politeness amused the other. \u201cIt was not a question of family,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no idea as to its ownership, only some person had been very careless--I found the necklace outside the safe. Some property had evidently been hidden in a hurry, and had fallen down.\u201d \u201cI am greatly obliged to you,\u201d said Wallis. \u201cYou removed what might possibly have been a great temptation for the honest Mr. Timmings.\u201d He took a key from his pocket, switched round the combination lock, and opened the safe. There was nothing in the first view to suggest that it was the storehouse of the most notorious thief in London. Every article therein had been most carefully wrapped and packed. He closed the door again. \u201cThat is only half the treasure,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly half-- what do you mean?\u201d Gilbert was genuinely surprised, and a little mocking smile played about the mouth of the other. \u201cI thought that would upset you,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is only half. I will show you something. Since you know so much, why shouldn\u2019t you know all?\u201d He walked back", "into the office. A door led into another room. He unlocked this, and opening it passed through, Gilbert following. Inside was a small room lit by a skylight. The centre of the room was occupied by what appeared to be a large cage. It was in reality a steel grill, which is sometimes sold by French firms to surround a safe. \u201cA pretty cage,\u201d said Mr. Wallis admiringly. He unlocked the tiny steel gate and stepped through, and Gilbert stepped after him. \u201cHow did you get it in?\u201d asked Gilbert curiously. \u201cIt was brought in in pieces, and has just been set up in order to show a customer. It is very easily taken apart, and two or three mechanics can clear it away in a day.\u201d \u201cIs this your other department?\u201d asked Gilbert dryly. \u201cIn a sense it is,\u201d said Wallis, \u201cand I will show you why. If you go to the corner and pull down the first bar you will see something which perhaps you have never seen before.\u201d Gilbert was half-way to the corner, when the transparency of the trick struck him. He turned quickly, but a revolver was pointed straight at his heart. \u201cPut up your hands, Mr. Gilbert Standerton,\u201d said George. \u201cYou may be perfectly bona fide in your intentions to share out, but I was thinking that I would rather finish to-night\u2019s job before I relinquish business. You see, it will be poetic justice. Your uncle----\u201d \u201cMy uncle!\u201d said Gilbert. \u201cYour uncle,\u201d bowed the other, \u201can admirable but testy old gentleman, who in one of our best safes has deposited nearly a quarter of a million pounds\u2019 worth of jewellery, the famous Standerton diamonds, which I suppose you will one day inherit.\u201d \u201cIs it not poetic justice,\u201d he asked as he backed his way out, still covering his prisoner with his revolver, \u201cto rob you just a little? Possibly,\u201d he went on, with grim humour, \u201cI also may have a conscience, and may attempt to restore to you the property which to-night I shall steal.\u201d He clanged the gate to, doubly locked it, and walked to the door which led to the office. \u201cYou will stay here for forty-eight hours,\u201d he said, \u201cat the end of which time you will be released--on my word. It may be inconvenient for you, but there are many inconvenient happenings in this life which we must endure. I commend you to Providence.\u201d He went out, and was gone for a quarter of an hour. Gilbert thought he had left, but he returned carrying a large jug of coffee, two brand new quart vacuum flasks, and two packages of what proved to be sandwiches. \u201cI cannot starve you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had better keep your coffee hot. You will have a long wait, and as you may be cold I have brought this.\u201d He went back to the office and carried out two heavy overcoats and thrust them through the bars. \u201cThat is very decent of you,\u201d said Gilbert.", "\u201cNot at all,\u201d said the polite Mr. Wallis. Gilbert was unarmed, and had he possessed a weapon it would have been of no service to him. The pistol had not left Wallis\u2019s hand, and even as he handed the food through the grill the butt of the automatic Colt was still gripped in his palm. \u201cI wish you a very good evening. If you would like to send a perfectly non-committal note to your wife, saying that you were too busy to come back, I should be delighted to see it delivered.\u201d He passed through the bars a sheet of paper and a stylograph pen. It was a thoughtful thing to do, and Gilbert appreciated it. This man, scoundrel as he was, had nicer instincts than many who had never brought themselves within the pale of the law. He scribbled a note excusing himself, folded up the sheet and placed it in the envelope, sealing it down before he realised that his captor would want to read it. \u201cI am very sorry,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you can open it, the gum is still wet.\u201d Wallis shook his head. \u201cIf you will tell me that there is nothing more than I asked you to write, or than I expected you to write, that is sufficient,\u201d he said. So he left Gilbert alone and with much to think about. CHAPTER XIII. THE MAKER OF WILLS General Sir John Standerton was a man of hateful and irascible temper. The excuse was urged for him that he had spent the greater portion of his life in India, a country calculated to undermine the sweetest disposition. He was a bachelor and lived alone, save for a small army of servants. He had renamed the country mansion he had purchased twenty years before: it was now known from one end of the country to the other as The Residency, and here he maintained an almost feudal state. His enemies said that he kept his battalion of servants at full strength so that he might always have somebody handy to swear at, but that was obviously spite. It was said, too, that every year a fresh firm of solicitors acted for him, and it is certain that he changed his banks with extraordinary rapidity. Leslie Frankfort was breakfasting with his brother one morning in his little Mayfair house. Jack Frankfort was a rising young solicitor, and a member of that firm which at the moment was acting for Sir John Standerton. \u201cBy the way,\u201d said Jack Frankfort, \u201cI am going to see an old friend of yours this afternoon.\u201d \u201cWho is my old friend?\u201d \u201cOld Standerton.\u201d \u201cGilbert?\u201d Jack Frankfort smiled. \u201cNo, Gilbert\u2019s terrible uncle; we are acting for him just now.\u201d \u201cWhat is the object of the visit?\u201d \u201cA will, my boy; we are going to make a will.\u201d \u201cI wonder how many wills the old man has made?\u201d mused Leslie. \u201cPoor Gilbert!\u201d \u201cWhy poor Gilbert?\u201d asked the other, helping himself to the marmalade. \u201cWhy, he was", "his uncle\u2019s heir for about ten minutes.\u201d Jack grinned. \u201cEverybody is old Standerton\u2019s heir for ten minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cI verily believe he has endowed every hospital, every dog\u2019s home, every cat\u2019s home, every freakish institution that the world has ever heard of, in the course of the last twenty years, and he is making another will to- day.\u201d \u201cPut in a good word for Gilbert,\u201d said Leslie with a smile. The other growled. \u201cThere is not a chance of putting in a good word for anybody. Old Tomlins, who acted for him last, said that the greater difficulty in making a will for the old beggar is to finish one before the old man has thought out another. Anyway, he is keen on a will just now, and I am going down to see him. Come along?\u201d \u201cYou know the old gentleman?\u201d \u201cNot on your life,\u201d said the other hastily. \u201cI know him indeed, and he knows me! He knows I am a pal of Gilbert\u2019s. I stayed once with him for about two days. For the Lord\u2019s sake do not confess that you are my brother, or he will find another firm of solicitors.\u201d \u201cI do not usually boast of my relationship with you,\u201d said Jack. \u201cYou are an offensive devil,\u201d said the other admiringly. \u201cBut I suppose you have to be, being a solicitor.\u201d Jack Frankfort journeyed down to Huntingdon that afternoon in the company of a pleasant man, with whom he found himself in conversation without any of that awkwardness of introductions which makes the average English passenger so impossible. This gentleman had evidently been in all parts of the world, and knew a great many people whom Jack knew. He chatted interestingly for an hour on the strange places of the earth, and when the train drew up at the little station at which Mr. Frankfort was alighting, the other accompanied him. \u201cWhat an extraordinary coincidence,\u201d said the stranger heartily. \u201cI am getting out here too. This is a rum little town, isn\u2019t it?\u201d It might be described as \u201crum,\u201d but it was very pleasant, and it contained one of the most comfortable hostelries in England. The fellow-passengers found themselves placed in adjoining rooms. Jack Frankfort had hoped to conclude his business before the evening and return to London by a late train, but he knew that it would be unwise to depend upon the old man\u2019s expedition. As a matter of fact, he had hardly been in the hotel a quarter of an hour before he received an intimation from The Residency that Sir John could not be seen until ten o\u2019clock that evening. \u201cThat settles all idea of going back to London,\u201d said Jack despairingly. He met his fellow-passenger at dinner. Though he was not particularly well acquainted with the habits of Sir John, he knew that one of his fads was to dine late, and since he had no desire to spend a hungry evening, he advanced the normal dinner hour of", "the little hotel by thirty minutes. He explained this apologetically to the comfortable man who sat opposite him, as they discussed a perfectly roasted capon. \u201cIt suits me very well,\u201d said the other, \u201cI have a lot of work to do in the neighbourhood. You see,\u201d he explained, \u201cI am the proprietor of the Safe Agency.\u201d \u201cSafe Agency,\u201d repeated the other wonderingly. The man nodded. \u201cIt seems a queer business, but it is a fairly extensive one,\u201d he said. \u201cWe deal principally in safes and strong rooms, second- hand or new. We have a pretty large establishment in London; but I am not going to overstep the bounds of politeness\u201d--he smiled--\u201cand try to sell you some of my stock.\u201d Frankfort was amused. \u201cSafe Agency,\u201d he said; \u201cone never realises that there can be money in that sort of thing.\u201d \u201cOne cannot realise that there is money in any branch of commerce,\u201d said the other. \u201cThe money-making concerns which appeal are those where one sees brains being turned into actual cash.\u201d \u201cSuch as----?\u201d \u201cSuch as a lawyer\u2019s business,\u201d smiled the other. \u201cOh, yes, I know you are a lawyer, you are the type, and I should have known your trade if I had not seen your dispatch case, and then your name.\u201d Jack Frankfort laughed. \u201cYou are sharp enough to be a lawyer yourself,\u201d he suggested. \u201cYou are paying yourself a compliment,\u201d said the other. Later, in the High Street, when he was calling a fly to drive him to The Residency, Jack noticed a big covered motor lorry, bearing only the simple inscription on its side: \u201cThe St. Bride\u2019s Safe Company.\u201d He saw also his pleasant companion speaking earnestly with the black- bearded chauffeur. A little later the lorry moved on through the narrow streets of the town and took the London Road. Jack Frankfort had no time to speculate upon the opportunities for safe selling which the little town offered, for five minutes later he was in Sir John Standerton\u2019s study. The old General was of the type which is frequently depicted in humorous papers. He was stout and red of face, and wore a close-cut strip of white whisker, which ended abruptly below his ear, and was continued in a wild streak of white moustache across his face. He was bald, save for a little fringe of white hair which ran from temple to temple via the occiput, and his conversation might be described as a succession of explosions. He stared up from under his ferocious eyebrow, as the young man entered the study, and took stock of him. He was used to lawyers. He had had every variety, and had divided them into two distinct classes--they were either rogues or fools. There was no intermediate stage with this old man, and he had no doubt in his mind that Jack Frankfort, a shrewd-looking young man, was to be classed in the former category. He bullied him into a seat. \u201cI want to see you about my will,\u201d", "he said. \u201cI have been seriously thinking lately of rearranging the distribution of my property.\u201d This was his invariable formula. It was intended to convey the impression that he had arrived at this present state of mind after very long and careful consideration, and that the making of wills was a serious and an important business to be undertaken, perhaps, once or twice in a man\u2019s lifetime. Jack nodded. \u201cVery good, General,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you a draft?\u201d \u201cI have no draft,\u201d snapped the other. \u201cI have a will which has already been prepared, and here is a copy.\u201d He threw it across to his solicitor. \u201cI do not know whether you have seen this?\u201d \u201cI think I have one in my bag,\u201d said Jack. \u201cWhat the devil do you mean by carrying my will about in your bag?\u201d snarled the other. \u201cThat is the only place I could think of,\u201d said the young man, calmly. \u201cYou would not like me to carry it about in my trouser\u2019s pocket, would you?\u201d The General stared. \u201cDo not be impertinent, young man,\u201d he said ominously. It was not a good beginning, but Jack knew that every method had been tried, from the sycophantic to the pompous, but none had succeeded, and the end of all endeavours, so far as the solicitors were concerned, had been the closing of their association with the General\u2019s estate. He was rather a valuable client if he could only be retained. No human solicitor had discovered a method of retaining him. \u201cVery well,\u201d said the General at last. \u201cNow please jot down exactly what my wishes are, and have the will drafted accordingly. In the first place, I revoke all former wills.\u201d Jack, with a sheet of paper and a pencil, nodded and noted the fact. \u201cIn the second place I want you to make absolutely certain that not a penny of my money goes to Dr. Sundle\u2019s Dogs\u2019 Home. The man has been insolent to me, and I hate dogs, anyhow. Not a penny of my money is to go to any hospital or to any charitable institution whatever.\u201d The old sinner declaimed this with relish. \u201cI had intended leaving a very large sum of money to a hospital fund,\u201d he explained, \u201cbut after the behaviour of this infernal Government----\u201d Jack might have asked in what way the old man expected to get even with the offending Government by denying support to all institutions designed to help the poor, but wisely kept the question in the background. \u201cNo charitable institution whatever.\u201d The old man spoke slowly, emphatically, thumping the table with every other word. \u201cA hundred pounds to the Army Temperance Association, though I think it is a jackass of an institution. A hundred pounds to the Soldiers\u2019 Home at Aldershot, and a thousand pounds if they make it non-sectarian.\u201d He grinned and added: \u201cIt will be Church of England to everlasting doomsday, so that money\u2019s safe! And,\u201d he added, \u201cno money to the Cottage Hospital", "here--do not let that bequest creep in. That stupid maniac of a doctor--I forget his beastly name--led the agitation for opening a right-o\u2019-way across my estate. I will \u2018right-o\u2019-way\u2019 him!\u201d he said viciously. He spent half an hour specifying the people who were not to benefit by his will, and the total amount of his reluctant bequests during that period did not exceed a thousand pounds. When he had finished he stared hopelessly at the young lawyer, and a momentary glint of humour came in the hard old blue eyes. \u201cI think we have disposed of everybody,\u201d he said, \u201cwithout disposing of anything. Do you know my nephew?\u201d he asked suddenly. \u201cI know a friend of your nephew.\u201d \u201cAre you related to that grinning idiot Leslie Frankfort?\u201d roared the old man. \u201cHe is my brother,\u201d said the other calmly. \u201cHumph,\u201d said the General, \u201cI thought I recognised the face. Have you met Gilbert Standerton?\u201d he asked suddenly. \u201cI have met him once or twice,\u201d said Jack Frankfort carelessly, \u201cas you may have met people, just to say \u2018how do you do?\u2019 and that sort of thing.\u201d \u201cI have never met people to say \u2018how do you do?\u2019 and that sort of thing,\u201d protested the old man with a snort. \u201cWhat sort of fellow do you think he is?\u201d he asked after a pause. The injunction of Leslie to \u201csay a good word for Gilbert\u201d came to the young man\u2019s mind. \u201cI think he is a very decent sort of fellow,\u201d he said, \u201cthough somewhat reserved and a little stand-offish.\u201d The old man glowered at him. \u201cMy nephew stand-offish?\u201d he snapped, \u201cOf course he is stand-offish. Do you think a Standerton is everybody\u2019s money? There is nothing Tommyish or Dickish or Harryish about our family, sir. We are all stand-offish, thank God! I am the most stand-offish man you ever met in your life.\u201d \u201cThat I can well believe,\u201d thought Jack, but did not give utterance to his thought. Instead he pursued the subject in his own cunning way. \u201cHe is the sort of man,\u201d he said innocently \u201cwhom I should think money would be rather wasted on.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d asked the General with rising wrath. Jack shrugged his shoulders. \u201cWell, he makes no great show, does not attempt to keep any particular place in London Society. In fact, he treats Society as though he were superior to it.\u201d \u201cAnd so he is,\u201d growled the General, \u201cwe are all superior to Society. Do you think, sir, that I care a damn about any of the people in this county? Do you think I am impressed by my Lord of High Towers and my Lady of the Grange, and the various upstart parvenu aristocrats that swarm over this country like--like--field mice? No sir! And I trust my nephew is in the same mind. Society as it is at present constituted is not worth that!\u201d He snapped his fingers in Jack\u2019s impassive face. \u201cThat settles it,\u201d said the General with decision. He pointed his", "finger at the notes which the other was taking. \u201cThe residue of my property I leave to Gilbert Standerton. Make a note of that.\u201d Twice had he uttered the same words in his lifetime, and twice had he changed his mind. It might well be that he would change his mind again. If the reputation he bore was justified, the morning would find him in another frame of mind. \u201cStay over to-morrow,\u201d he said at parting. \u201cBring me the draft at breakfast time.\u201d \u201cAt what hour?\u201d asked Jack politely. \u201cAt breakfast time,\u201d roared the old man. \u201cWhat is your breakfast hour?\u201d \u201cThe same hour as every other civilised human being,\u201d snapped the General \u201cat twenty-five minutes to one. What time do you breakfast, for Heaven\u2019s sake?\u201d \u201cAt twenty to one,\u201d said Jack sweetly, and was pleased with himself all the way back to the hotel. He did not see his train companion that night, but met him at breakfast the next morning at the Christian hour of half-past eight. Something had happened in the meantime to change the equable and cheery character of the other. He was sombre and silent, and he looked worried, almost ill, Jack thought. Possibly there was a bad time for safe selling, as there was a bad time for every other department of trade. Thinking this, he kept off the subject of business, and scarcely half a dozen sentences were exchanged between the two during the meal. Returning to The Residency, Jack Frankfort found with surprise that the old man had not changed his mind over night. He was still of the same opinion; seemed more emphatically so. Indeed, Jack had the greatest difficulty in preventing him from striking off a miserable hundred pounds bequest which he had made to a northern dispensary. \u201cThe whole of the money should be kept in the family,\u201d said the General shortly; \u201cit is absurd to fritter away little hundreds like this, it handicaps a man. I do not suppose he will have the handling of the money for many years yet, but \u2018forethought,\u2019 sir, is the motto of our family.\u201d It was all to Gilbert\u2019s advantage that the lawyer persisted in demanding the restoration of the dispensary bequest. In the end the General cut out every bequest in the will, and in the shortest document which he had ever signed bequeathed the whole of his property, movable and immovable, to \u201cmy dear nephew\u201d absolutely. \u201cHe is married isn\u2019t he?\u201d he asked. \u201cI believe he is,\u201d said Jack Frankfort. \u201cYou believe! Now what is the good of your believing?\u201d protested the old man. \u201cYou are my lawyer, and your business is to know everything. Find out if he is married, who his wife is, where she came from, and ask them up to dinner.\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d demanded the startled lawyer. \u201cTo-night,\u201d said the old man. \u201cThere is a man coming down from Yorkshire to see me, my doctor, we will make a jolly party. Is she pretty?\u201d \u201cI believe she", "is.\u201d Jack hesitated, for he was honestly in doubt. He knew very little about Gilbert Standerton or his affairs. \u201cIf she is pretty, and she is a lady,\u201d said the old General slowly, \u201cI will also make provision for her separately.\u201d Jack\u2019s heart sank. Would this mean another will? For good or ill, the wires were dispatched. Edith received hers and read it in wonder. Gilbert\u2019s remained on the hall table, for he had not been home the previous night nor during that day. The tear-reddened eyes of the girl offered eloquent testimony to the interest she displayed in his movements. CHAPTER XIV. THE STANDERTON DIAMONDS Edith Standerton made a quick preparation for her journey. She would take her maid into Huntingdon, and go without Gilbert. It was embarrassing that she must go alone, but she had set herself a task, and if she could help her husband by appearing at the dinner of his irritable relative she would do so. She had her evening things packed, and caught the four o\u2019clock train for the town of Tinley. The old man did her the exceptional honour of meeting her at the station. \u201cWhere is Gilbert?\u201d he asked when they had mutually introduced themselves. \u201cHe has been called out of town unexpectedly,\u201d she said. \u201cHe will be awfully upset when he knows.\u201d \u201cI think not,\u201d said the old General grimly. \u201cIt takes a great deal to upset Gilbert--certainly more than an opportunity of being reconciled to a grouchy old man. As a matter of fact,\u201d he went on, \u201cthere is no reconciliation necessary; but I always look upon anybody whom I have to cut out of my will as one who regards me as a mortal enemy.\u201d \u201cPlease never put me in your will.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that,\u201d said he, and added gallantly, \u201cthough I think Nature has sufficiently endowed you to enable you to dispense with such mundane gifts as money!\u201d She made a little face at that. He was delighted with her, and found her a charming companion. Edith Standerton exerted herself to please him. She had a style of treating people older than herself in such a way as to suggest that she was as young as they. I do not know any other phrase which would more exactly convey my meaning than that. She had a charm which appealed to this wayward old man. Edith did not know the cause of the change in her husband\u2019s fortunes. She knew very little, indeed, of his affairs; enough she knew that for some reason or other he had been disinherited through no fault of his own. She did not even know that it was the result of a caprice of this old man. \u201cYou must come again and bring Gilbert,\u201d said the General, before they dispersed to dress for dinner. \u201cI shall be delighted to put you both up.\u201d Fortunately she was saved the embarrassment of an answer, for the General jumped up suddenly. \u201cI", "know what you\u2019d like to see,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019d like to see the Standerton diamonds, and so you shall!\u201d She had no desire to see the Standerton diamonds, had, indeed, no knowledge that such an heirloom existed; but he was delighted at the prospect of showing her, and she, being a woman, was not averse to a view of these precious jewels, even though she were not destined to wear them. He led the way up to the library, and Jack Frankfort followed. \u201cThere they are,\u201d said the old man proudly, and pointed to a big safe in the corner, a large and ornate safe. \u201cThat is something new,\u201d he said proudly. \u201cI bought it from a man who wanted sixty guineas for it--an infernal, swindling, travelling rascal! I got it for thirty. What do you think of that for a safe?\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s very pretty,\u201d said Jack. He could think of nothing more fitting. The old man glared at him. \u201cPretty!\u201d he growled. \u201cWhat do you think I want with \u2018pretty\u2019 things in my library?\u201d He took a bunch of keys from his pocket and opened the door of the safe, pulled open a drawer, and took out a large morocco case. \u201cThere they are!\u201d he said with pride, and indeed he might well be proud of such a beautiful collection. With all a girl\u2019s love for pretty things Edith handled the gorgeous jewels eagerly. The setting was old- fashioned, but it was the old fashion which was at that moment being copied. The stones sparkled and glittered as though every facet carried a tiny electric lamp to send forth the green, blue and roseate gleam of its fire. Even Jack Frankfort, no great lover of jewellery, was fascinated by the sight. \u201cWhy, sir,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are nearly a hundred thousand pounds\u2019 worth of gems there.\u201d \u201cMore,\u201d said the old man. \u201cI\u2019ve a pearl necklace here,\u201d and he pulled out another drawer, \u201clook at it. There is nearly two hundred thousand pounds\u2019 worth of jewellery in that safe.\u201d \u201cIn a thirty-guinea safe,\u201d said Jack unwisely. The old man turned on him. \u201cIn a sixty-guinea safe,\u201d he corrected violently. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you I beat the devil down? I beg your pardon, my dear.\u201d He chuckled at the thought, replaced the jewels, and locked the safe again. \u201cSixty guineas he wanted. Came here with all his fine City of London manner, frock-coat, top-hat, and patent boots, my dear. The way these people get up is scandalous. He might have been a gentleman by the airs he gave himself.\u201d Jack looked at the safe. He had some ideas of commercial values. \u201cI can\u2019t understand how he sold it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis safe is worth two hundred pounds.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d The old General turned on his lawyer in astonishment. Jack nodded. \u201cI have one at my office, now that I come to think of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt cost two hundred and twenty pounds, and it is the same make.\u201d \u201cHe", "only asked me sixty guineas.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s strange. Do you mind opening it again? I\u2019d like to see the bolts.\u201d The General, nothing loath, turned the key and pulled open the huge door. Jack looked at the square, steel bolts-- they were absolutely new. \u201cI can\u2019t understand how he offered it for sixty. You certainly had a bargain for thirty, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I have,\u201d said the General complacently. \u201cBy the way, I am expecting a man to dinner to-night,\u201d he went on, as he led the way back to the drawing-room, \u201ca doctor man from Yorkshire--Barclay-Seymour. Do you know him?\u201d Jack did not know him, but the girl broke in-- \u201cOh, yes, he is quite an old friend of mine.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s rather a fool,\u201d said the General, adopting his simple method of classification. Edith smiled. \u201cYou told me yesterday that there were only two classes of people, General--rogues and fools. I am wondering,\u201d she said demurely, \u201cin which class you place me.\u201d The old man wrinkled his brows. He looked at the beautiful young face in his high good humour. \u201cI must make a new class for you,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, you shall be in a class by yourself. But since most women are fools----\u201d \u201cOh, come!\u201d she protested, laughingly. \u201cThey are,\u201d he averred. \u201cLook at me. If women weren\u2019t fools shouldn\u2019t I have had a wife? If any brilliant, ingenious lady, possessed of the necessary determination had pursued me and had cultivated me, I should not be a bachelor, leaving my money to people who don\u2019t care two--pins,\u201d he hastily substituted a milder phrase for the one he had intended, \u201cwhether I\u2019m alive or dead. Does your husband know the Doctor, by the way?\u201d The girl shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said. \u201cThey nearly met one night at dinner, but Gilbert had an engagement.\u201d \u201cBut Gilbert knows him,\u201d insisted the old man. \u201cI\u2019ve often talked to him about Barclay-Seymour, who, by the way, is perhaps not such a fool as most doctors. I used to be rather more enthusiastic about him than I have been lately,\u201d he admitted, \u201cand I\u2019m afraid I used to ram old Barclay-Seymour down poor Gilbert\u2019s throat more than his ability or genius justified me doing. Has he never spoken about him?\u201d The girl shook her head. \u201cUngrateful devil!\u201d growled the old General inconsequently. One of his many footmen came into the drawing-room at that moment with a telegram on a salver. \u201cHey hey?\u201d demanded Sir John, fixing his glasses on the tip of his nose and scowling up at his servant. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d \u201cA telegram, Sir John,\u201d replied the footman. \u201cI can see it\u2019s a telegram, you ass! When did it come?\u201d \u201cA few minutes ago, sir.\u201d \u201cWho brought it?\u201d \u201cA telegraph boy, Sir John,\u201d said the imperturbable servitor. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so at first?\u201d snapped Sir John Standerton in a tone of relief. And Edith had all she could do to prevent herself from bursting into a", "fit of laughter at the little scene. The old man opened the telegram, spread it out, read it slowly and frowned. He read it again. \u201cNow, what on earth does that mean?\u201d he asked, and handed the telegram to the girl. She read-- \u201cTake the Standerton jewels out of your safe and deposit them without fail in your bank to-night. If it is too late to send them to your bank place them under an armed guard.\u201d It was signed \u201cGilbert Standerton.\u201d CHAPTER XV. THE TALE THE DOCTOR TOLD The General read the telegram again. He was, despite his erratic temperament, a shrewd and intelligent man. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d he asked quietly for him. \u201cWhere is Gilbert? And where does he wire from?\u201d He picked up the telegram and inspected it. It was handed in at the General Post Office at London at 6.35 p.m. The General\u2019s hour for dining was consonant with his breakfast hour, and it was a quarter after nine when the dinner gong brought Edith Standerton down from her room. She was worried; she could not understand the reference to the jewels. What had made Gilbert send this message? Had she known more of the circumstances of what had happened on the previous afternoon she would have wondered rather how he was able to send the message. The General took the warning seriously, but not so seriously that he was prepared to remove his jewellery to any other receptacle. Indeed, the purchase of the safe had been made necessary by the fact that beyond the butler\u2019s strong room, which was strong only in an etymological sense, there was no security for property of any value. He had made an inspection of the jewels in the safe and had relocked the door, leaving a servant in the library, with strict instructions not to come out until he was instructed to leave by his master. Edith came down to find that another guest had arrived, a guest who greeted her with a cheery and familiar smile. \u201cHow do you do, Doctor?\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not so long since I met you at mother\u2019s. You remember me?\u201d \u201cI remember you perfectly,\u201d said Dr. Barclay- Seymour. He was a tall, thin man with a straggling iron-grey beard and a high forehead. A little absent in his manner, he conveyed the impression, never a very flattering one, that he had matters more weighty to think about than the conversation which was being addressed to him. He was, perhaps, the most noteworthy of the provincial doctors. He came out of his shell sufficiently to recognise her and to remember her mother. Mrs. Cathcart had been a great friend of Barclay\u2019s. They had grown up together. \u201cYour mother is a very wonderful woman,\u201d said Dr. Barclay-Seymour as he took the girl in to dinner, \u201ca remarkable woman.\u201d Edith was seized with an almost overwhelming temptation to ask why. It would have been unpardonable of her had she done so, but never", "did a word so tremble upon a human being\u2019s lips as that upon hers. They ate through dinner, which was made a little uncomfortable by the fact that General Sir John Standerton was unquestionably nervous. Twice during the course of the meal he sent out one of the three footmen who waited at table to visit what he termed the outpost. Nothing untoward had happened on either occasion. \u201cI do not know what to do about this jewellery. I hope that Gilbert is not playing the fool,\u201d he said. He turned to Edith with a genial scowl. \u201cHas he developed any kittenish ways of late?\u201d She smiled. \u201cThere is no word which less describes Gilbert than kittenish,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it not remarkable that he sent that message?\u201d the General went on testily. \u201cI hardly know what to do. I could get a constable up, but the police here are the most awful and appalling idiots. I have a great mind to have my bed put in the library and sleep there myself.\u201d He brightened up at the thought. He had reached the stage in life when sleeping in any other room than that to which he was accustomed represented a form of heroism. After the dinner was through they made their way to the drawing-room. The General was fidgety, and though Edith played and sang a little French love song with no evidence of agitation, she was as nervous as the General. \u201cI tell you what we will do,\u201d said Sir John suddenly, \u201cwe will all adjourn to the library. It is a jolly nice room if you do not mind our smoking.\u201d It was an excellent suggestion, and one that she accepted with pleasure. She was the only lady of the party, and remarked on the fact as she went upstairs with Sir John. He glanced hurriedly round. \u201cI always regard a doctor as a fit chaperone for any lady,\u201d he said with a chuckle--it amused him. Later he found the complement of the joke, and discoursed loudly upon old women of all professions, a discourse which was arrested by the arrival of the Doctor and Jack Frankfort. The library was a big room, and it was chiefly remarkable for the fact that it contained no more evidence of Sir John\u2019s literary taste than a number of volumes of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica and a shelf full of Ruff\u2019s Guide to the Turf. It was, however, a delightful room, panelled in old oak with mullioned windows standing in deep recesses. These, explained Sir John, opened out on to a terrace--an excellent reason for his apprehension. \u201cPull the curtain, William,\u201d said Sir John to the waiting footman, \u201cand then you can clear out. Have the coffee brought in here.\u201d The man pulled the heavy velvet curtains across the big recesses, placed a chair for the girl, and retired. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d said Sir John. He went across to the safe and opened it again. He inspected the case. Nothing had been", "disturbed. \u201cAh,\u201d he breathed--It was a sigh of infinite relief. \u201cThis wire of Gilbert\u2019s is getting on my nerves,\u201d he excused himself irritably. \u201cWhat the devil did he wire for? Is he the sort of man that sends telegrams to save himself the bother of licking down an envelope?\u201d Edith shook her head. \u201cI am as much in the dark as you,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I assure you that Gilbert is not an alarmist.\u201d \u201cHow do you get on with him?\u201d he asked her. The girl flushed a little. \u201cI get on very well,\u201d she said, and strove to turn the conversation. But it was a known fact that no human soul had ever turned Sir John from his set inquisitional course. \u201cHappy, and that sort of thing?\u201d he asked. Edith nodded, keeping her eyes on the wall behind the General\u2019s head. \u201cI suppose you love him --hey?\u201d Edith was embarrassed, and no less so were the two men; but Sir John was not alone in imagining that doctors have little sense of decency and lawyers no idea of propriety. They were saved further discussion by the arrival of the coffee, and the girl was thankful. \u201cI am going to keep you here until Gilbert comes up for you,\u201d said the old man suddenly. \u201cI suppose you know, but probably you do not, that you are the first of your sex that I have ever tolerated in my house.\u201d She laughed. \u201cIt is a fact,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cYou know I do not get on with women. They do not realise that though I am an irritable old chap there is really no harm in me, and I am an irritable old chap,\u201d he confessed. \u201cIt is not that they are impertinent or rude, but it is their long-suffering meekness that I cannot stand. If a lady tells me to go to the devil I know where I am. I want the plain, blunt truth without gaff. I prefer my medicine without sugar.\u201d The Doctor laughed. \u201cYou are different from most people, Sir John. I know men who are rather sensitive about the brutal truth.\u201d \u201cMore fools they,\u201d said Sir John. \u201cI do not know,\u201d said the Doctor reflectively. \u201cI sympathise with a man who does not want the whole bitterness of fact hurled at his head in the shape of an honest half a brick, although there is an advantage in knowing the truth sometimes, it saves a lot of needless unhappiness,\u201d he added a little sadly. He seemed to have aroused some unpleasant train of thought. \u201cI will give you an extraordinary instance,\u201d he went on in his usual deliberate manner. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d asked the General suddenly. \u201cI think it was a noise in the hall,\u201d said Edith. \u201cI thought it was a window,\u201d growled the General, rather ashamed that he should have been detected in his jump. \u201cGo on with your story, Doctor.\u201d \u201cA few months ago,\u201d Dr. Seymour recalled, \u201ca young man came to me. He", "was a gentleman, and evidently not a townsman of Leeds, at any rate I did not know him. I found afterwards that he had come from London to consult me. He had some little tooth trouble, a jagged molar, a very commonplace thing, and he had made a slight incision in the inside of his mouth. Apparently it worried him, the more so when he discovered that the tiny scratch would not heal. Like most of us, he had a terrible dread of cancer.\u201d He lowered his voice as a doctor often will when he speaks of this most dreadful malady. \u201cHe did not want to go to his own doctor; as a matter of fact, I do not think he had one. He came to me, and I examined him. I had my doubt as to there being anything wrong with him, but I cut a minute section of the membrane for microscopic examination.\u201d The girl shivered. \u201cI am sorry,\u201d said the Doctor hastily, \u201cthat is all there is in the story which is gruesome unless you think---- However,\u201d he went on, \u201cI promised to send him the result of my examination, and I wanted his address to send it. This, however, he refused. He was very, very nervous. \u2018I know I am a moral coward,\u2019 he said, \u2018but somehow I do not want to know just the bare truth in bald language; but if it is as I fear, I would like the news broken to me in the manner which is the least jarring to me.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd what was that?\u201d asked Sir John, interested in spite of himself. The Doctor drew a long breath. \u201cIt seems,\u201d he said, \u201cthat he was something of a musician\u201d--Edith sat upright, clasping her hands, her face set, her eyes fixed upon the Doctor--\u201che was something of a musician, that is to say, he was very keen on music, and the method he had of breaking the news to himself was unique, I have never heard anything quite like it before in my life. He gave me two cards and an addressed envelope, addressed to an old musician in London whom he patronised.\u201d Edith saw the room go swaying round and round, but held herself in with an effort. Her face was white, her hands that held the chair were clenched so tightly that the bones shone white through them. \u201cThey were addressed to an old friend of his, as I say, and they were identically worded with this exception. One of them said in effect you will go to such and such a place and you will play the \u2018Melody in F,\u2019 and the other gave the same instructions but varied to this extent, that he was to play the \u2018Spring Song.\u2019 Now here comes the tragedy.\u201d He raised his finger. \u201cHe gave me the \u2018Melody in F\u2019 to signal to him the fact that he had cancer.\u201d There was a long silence, which only the quick breathing of the girl", "broke. \u201cAnd, and--?\u201d whispered Edith. \u201cAnd\u201d--the Doctor looked at her with his far-away eyes--\u201cI sent the wrong card,\u201d he said. \u201cI sent it and destroyed the other before I remembered my error.\u201d \u201cThen he has not cancer?\u201d whispered the girl. \u201cNo, and I do not know his address, and I cannot get at him,\u201d said Barclay-Seymour. \u201cIt was tragic in many ways. I think he was just going to marry, for he said this much to me: \u2018If this is true, and I am married, I will leave my wife a pauper,\u2019 and he asked me a curious question,\u201d added the Doctor. \u201cHe said, \u2018Don\u2019t you think that a man condemned to die is justified in taking any action, committing any crime, for the protection of the loved ones he leaves behind?\u2019\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d said Edith. Her voice was hollow and sounded remote to her. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d said the General, and jumped up. This time there was no doubt. Jack Frankfort sprang to the curtain that covered the recess and pulled it aside. There stood Gilbert Standerton, white as a ghost, his eyes staring into vacancy, the hand at his mouth shaking. \u201cThe wrong card!\u201d he said. \u201cMy God!\u201d CHAPTER XVI. BRADSHAW A month later Gilbert Standerton came back from the Foreign Office to his little house in St. John\u2019s Wood. \u201cThere is a man to see you, Gilbert,\u201d said his wife. \u201cI think I know, it is my bank manager,\u201d he said. He greeted the tall man who rose to meet him with a cheery smile. \u201cNow, Mr. Brown,\u201d he said, \u201cI have to explain to you exactly what I want done. There is a man in America, he has been there some week or two, to whom I owe a large sum of money--eighty thousand pounds, to be exact--and I want you to see that I have sufficient fluent capital to pay it.\u201d \u201cYou have quite sufficient, Mr. Standerton,\u201d said the manager, \u201ceven now, without selling any of your securities.\u201d \u201cThat is good. You will have all the particulars here,\u201d said Gilbert, and took a folded sheet of paper from his pocket. \u201cIt is really a trust, in the sense that it is to be transferred to two men, Thomas Black and George Smith. They may sub-divide it again, because I believe,\u201d he smiled, \u201cthey have other business associates who happen to be entitled to share.\u201d \u201cI did not congratulate you, Mr. Standerton,\u201d said the bank manager, \u201cupon the marvellous service you rendered the city. They say that through you every penny which was stolen by the famous Wallis gang has been recovered.\u201d \u201cI think that pretty well described the position,\u201d said Gilbert quietly. \u201cI was reading an account of it in a paper the other day,\u201d the bank manager went on. \u201cIt was very providential that there was an alarm of fire next door to their headquarters.\u201d \u201cIt was providential that it was found before the fire reached the Safe Company\u2019s premises,\u201d said Gilbert. \u201cFortunately the", "firemen saw me through the skylight. That made things rather easy, but it was some time before they got me out, as you probably know.\u201d \u201cDid you ever see this man Wallis?\u201d asked the bank manager curiously. \u201cDidn\u2019t the papers tell you that?\u201d bantered Gilbert with a dry smile. \u201cThey say you learnt in some way that there was to be a burglary at your uncle\u2019s, and that you went up to his place, and there you saw Mr. Wallis under the very window of the library, on the parapet or something.\u201d \u201cOn the terrace it was,\u201d said Gilbert quietly. \u201cAnd that he flew at the sight of you?\u201d \u201cThat is hardly true,\u201d said Gilbert, \u201crather put it that I persuaded him to go. I was not sure that he had not already secured the necklace, and I went through the window into the room without realising there was anybody there. You see, there were heavy curtains which hid the light. Whilst I was there he escaped, that is all.\u201d He made one or two suggestions regarding the transfer of the money and showed the bank manager out, then he joined Edith in the drawing-room. She came to him with a little smile. \u201cDoes the Foreign Office seem very strange to you?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt did seem rather strange after my other exploits.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI never thought Sir John had sufficient influence to get you back.\u201d \u201cI think he has greater influence than you imagine,\u201d he said; \u201cbut then there were other considerations. You see, I was able to render the Foreign Office one or two little acts of service in the course of my nefarious career, and they have been very good.\u201d She looked at him wistfully. \u201cAnd do we go back now to where we started?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhere did we start?\u201d he countered. \u201cI do not know that we started anywhere,\u201d she said thoughtfully. She had been looking at a time table when he came into the room, and now she picked it up and turned the pages idly. \u201cAre you interested in that Bradshaw?\u201d \u201cVery,\u201d she said. \u201cI am just deciding.\u201d \u201cDeciding what?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhere--where we shall spend our honeymoon,\u201d she faltered.
