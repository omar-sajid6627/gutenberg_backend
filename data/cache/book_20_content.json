Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast Brought Death into the World, and all our woe, With loss of Eden, till one greater Man Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat, Sing Heav\u2019nly Muse, that on the secret top Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed, In the Beginning how the Heav\u2019ns and Earth Rose out of Chaos: Or if Sion Hill Delight thee more, and Siloa\u2019s Brook that flow\u2019d Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song, That with no middle flight intends to soar Above th\u2019 Aonian Mount, while it pursues Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime. And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer Before all Temples th\u2019 upright heart and pure, Instruct me, for Thou know\u2019st; Thou from the first Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss And mad\u2019st it pregnant: What in me is dark Illumine, what is low raise and support; That to the highth of this great Argument I may assert th\u2019 Eternal Providence, And justifie the wayes of God to men. Say first, for Heav\u2019n hides nothing from thy view Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause Mov\u2019d our Grand Parents in that happy State, Favour\u2019d of Heav\u2019n so highly, to fall off From their Creator, and transgress his Will For one restraint, Lords of the World besides? Who first seduc\u2019d them to that fowl revolt? Th\u2019 infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv\u2019d The Mother of Mankinde, what time his Pride Had cast him out from Heav\u2019n, with all his Host Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring To set himself in Glory above his Peers, He trusted to have equal\u2019d the most High, If he oppos\u2019d; and with ambitious aim Against the Throne and Monarchy of God Rais\u2019d impious War in Heav\u2019n and Battel proud With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power Hurld headlong flaming from th\u2019 Ethereal Skie With hideous ruine and combustion down To bottomless perdition, there to dwell In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire, Who durst defie th\u2019 Omnipotent to Arms. Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night To mortal men, he with his horrid crew Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe Confounded though immortal: But his doom Reserv\u2019d him to more wrath; for now the thought Both of lost happiness and lasting pain Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes That witness\u2019d huge affliction and dismay Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate: At once as far as Angels kenn he views The dismal Situation waste and wilde, A Dungeon horrible, on all sides", "round As one great Furnace flam\u2019d, yet from those flames No light, but rather darkness visible Serv\u2019d only to discover sights of woe, Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace And rest can never dwell, hope never comes That comes to all; but torture without end Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed With ever- burning Sulphur unconsum\u2019d: Such place Eternal Justice had prepar\u2019d For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain\u2019d In utter darkness, and their portion set As far remov\u2019d from God and light of Heav\u2019n As from the Center thrice to th\u2019 utmost Pole. O how unlike the place from whence they fell! There the companions of his fall, o\u2019rewhelm\u2019d With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire, He soon discerns, and weltring by his side One next himself in power, and next in crime, Long after known in Palestine, and nam\u2019d Beelzebub. To whom th\u2019 Arch-Enemy, And thence in Heav\u2019n call\u2019d Satan, with bold words Breaking the horrid silence thus began. If thou beest he; But O how fall\u2019n! how chang\u2019d From him, who in the happy Realms of Light Cloth\u2019d with transcendent brightnes didst outshine Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league, United thoughts and counsels, equal hope, And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize, Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest From what highth fal\u2019n, so much the stronger provd He with his Thunder: and till then who knew The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage Can else inflict do I repent or change, Though chang\u2019d in outward lustre; that fixt mind And high disdain, from sence of injur\u2019d merit, That with the mightiest rais\u2019d me to contend, And to the fierce contention brought along Innumerable force of Spirits arm\u2019d That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring, His utmost power with adverse power oppos\u2019d In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav\u2019n, And shook his throne. What though the field be lost? All is not lost; the unconquerable Will, And study of revenge, immortal hate, And courage never to submit or yield: And what is else not to be overcome? That Glory never shall his wrath or might Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace With suppliant knee, and deifie his power Who from the terrour of this Arm so late Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed, That were an ignominy and shame beneath This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods And this Empyreal substance cannot fail, Since through experience of this great event In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc\u2019t, We may with more successful hope resolve To wage by force or guile eternal Warr Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe, Who now triumphs, and in th\u2019 excess of joy Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav\u2019n. So spake th\u2019 Apostate Angel, though in pain, Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare: And him thus answer\u2019d soon his bold", "Compeer. O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers, That led th\u2019 imbattelld Seraphim to Warr Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds Fearless, endanger\u2019d Heav\u2019ns perpetual King; And put to proof his high Supremacy, Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate, Too well I see and rue the dire event, That with sad overthrow and foul defeat Hath lost us Heav\u2019n, and all this mighty Host In horrible destruction laid thus low, As far as Gods and Heav\u2019nly Essences Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains Invincible, and vigour soon returns, Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state Here swallow\u2019d up in endless misery. But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now Of force believe Almighty, since no less Then such could hav orepow\u2019rd such force as ours) Have left us this our spirit and strength intire Strongly to suffer and support our pains, That we may so suffice his vengeful ire, Or do him mightier service as his thralls By right of Warr, what e\u2019re his business be Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire, Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep; What can it then avail though yet we feel Strength undiminisht, or eternal being To undergo eternal punishment? Whereto with speedy words th\u2019 Arch-fiend reply\u2019d. Fall\u2019n Cherube, to be weak is miserable Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure, To do ought good never will be our task, But ever to do ill our sole delight, As being the contrary to his high will Whom we resist. If then his Providence Out of our evil seek to bring forth good, Our labour must be to pervert that end, And out of good still to find means of evil; Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb His inmost counsels from their destind aim. But see the angry Victor hath recall\u2019d His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit Back to the Gates of Heav\u2019n: The Sulphurous Hail Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice Of Heav\u2019n receiv\u2019d us falling, and the Thunder, Wing\u2019d with red Lightning and impetuous rage, Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep. Let us not slip th\u2019 occasion, whether scorn, Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe. Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde, The seat of desolation, voyd of light, Save what the glimmering of these livid flames Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend From off the tossing of these fiery waves, There rest, if any rest can harbour there, And reassembling our afflicted Powers, Consult how we may henceforth most offend Our Enemy, our own loss how repair, How overcome this dire Calamity, What reinforcement we may gain from Hope, If not what resolution from despare. Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes That sparkling", "blaz\u2019d, his other Parts besides Prone on the Flood, extended long and large Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge As whom the Fables name of monstrous size, Titanian, or Earth-born, that warr\u2019d on Jove, Briarios or Typhon, whom the Den By ancient Tarsus held, or that Sea-beast Leviathan, which God of all his works Created hugest that swim th\u2019 Ocean stream: Him haply slumbring on the Norway foam The Pilot of some small night-founder\u2019d Skiff, Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell, With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes: So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay Chain\u2019d on the burning Lake, nor ever thence Had ris\u2019n or heav\u2019d his head, but that the will And high permission of all-ruling Heaven Left him at large to his own dark designs, That with reiterated crimes he might Heap on himself damnation, while he sought Evil to others, and enrag\u2019d might see How all his malice serv\u2019d but to bring forth Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn On Man by him seduc\u2019t, but on himself Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour\u2019d. Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, & rowld In billows, leave i\u2019th\u2019 midst a horrid Vale. Then with expanded wings he stears his flight Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land He lights, if it were Land that ever burn\u2019d With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire; And such appear\u2019d in hue, as when the force Of subterranean wind transports a Hill Torn from Pelorus, or the shatter\u2019d side Of thundring Aetna, whose combustible And fewel\u2019d entrals thence conceiving Fire, Sublim\u2019d with Mineral fury, aid the Winds, And leave a singed bottom all involv\u2019d With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole Of unblest feet. Him followed his next Mate, Both glorying to have scap\u2019t the Stygian flood As Gods, and by their own recover\u2019d strength, Not by the sufferance of supernal Power. Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime, Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat That we must change for Heav\u2019n, this mournful gloom For that celestial light? Be it so, since hee Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid What shall be right: fardest from him is best Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream Above his equals. Farewel happy Fields Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings A mind not to be chang\u2019d by Place or Time. The mind is its own place, and in it self Can make a Heav\u2019n of Hell, a Hell of Heav\u2019n. What matter where, if I be still the same, And what I should be, all but less then hee Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here", "at least We shall be free; th\u2019 Almighty hath not built Here for his envy, will not drive us hence: Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce To reign is worth ambition though in Hell: Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav\u2019n. But wherefore let we then our faithful friends, Th\u2019 associates and copartners of our loss Lye thus astonisht on th\u2019 oblivious Pool, And call them not to share with us their part In this unhappy Mansion, or once more With rallied Arms to try what may be yet Regaind in Heav\u2019n, or what more lost in Hell? So Satan spake, and him Beelzebub Thus answer\u2019d. Leader of those Armies bright, Which but th\u2019 Omnipotent none could have foyld, If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge Of battel when it rag\u2019d, in all assaults Their surest signal, they will soon resume New courage and revive, though now they lye Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire, As we erewhile, astounded and amaz\u2019d, No wonder, fall\u2019n such a pernicious highth. He scarce had ceas\u2019t when the superiour Fiend Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield Ethereal temper, massy, large and round, Behind him cast; the broad circumference Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb Through Optic Glass the Tuscan Artist views At Ev\u2019ning from the top of Fesole, Or in Valdarno, to descry new Lands, Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe. His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the Mast Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand, He walkt with to support uneasie steps Over the burning Marle, not like those steps On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire; Nathless he so endur\u2019d, till on the Beach Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call\u2019d His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans\u2019t Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks In Vallombrosa, where th\u2019 Etrurian shades High overarch\u2019t imbowr; or scatterd sedge Afloat, when with fierce Winds Orion arm\u2019d Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew Busiris and his Memphian Chivalrie, VVhile with perfidious hatred they pursu\u2019d The Sojourners of Goshen, who beheld From the safe shore their floating Carkases And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood, Under amazement of their hideous change. He call\u2019d so loud, that all the hollow Deep Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates, Warriers, the Flowr of Heav\u2019n, once yours, now lost, If such astonishment as this can sieze Eternal spirits; or have ye chos\u2019n this place After the toyl of Battel to repose Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav\u2019n? Or in this abject posture have ye sworn To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood", "With scatter\u2019d Arms and Ensigns, till anon His swift pursuers from Heav\u2019n Gates discern Th\u2019 advantage, and descending tread us down Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe. Awake, arise, or be for ever fall\u2019n. They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread, Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake. Nor did they not perceave the evil plight In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel; Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd Innumerable. As when the potent Rod Of Amrams Son in Egypts evill day Wav\u2019d round the Coast, up call\u2019d a pitchy cloud Of Locusts, warping on the Eastern Wind, That ore the Realm of impious Pharoah hung Like Night, and darken\u2019d all the Land of Nile: So numberless were those bad Angels seen Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell \u2019Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires; Till, as a signal giv\u2019n, th\u2019 uplifted Spear Of their great Sultan waving to direct Thir course, in even ballance down they light On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain; A multitude, like which the populous North Pour\u2019d never from her frozen loyns, to pass Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous Sons Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread Beneath Gibraltar to the Lybian sands. Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms Excelling human, Princely Dignities, And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones; Though of their Names in heav\u2019nly Records now Be no memorial, blotted out and ras\u2019d By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life. Nor had they yet among the Sons of Eve Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth, Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man, By falsities and lyes the greatest part Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake God their Creator, and th\u2019 invisible Glory of him, that made them, to transform Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn\u2019d With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold, And Devils to adore for Deities: Then were they known to men by various Names, And various Idols through the Heathen World. Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last, Rous\u2019d from the slumber, on that fiery Couch, At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth Came singly where he stood on the bare strand, While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof? The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix Their Seats long after next the Seat of God, Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador\u2019d Among the Nations round, and durst abide Jehovah thundring out of Sion, thron\u2019d Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac\u2019d Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines, Abominations; and with cursed things His holy Rites,", "and solemn Feasts profan\u2019d, And with their darkness durst affront his light. First Moloch, horrid King besmear\u2019d with blood Of human sacrifice, and parents tears, Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire To his grim Idol. Him the Ammonite Worshipt in Rabba and her watry Plain, In Argob and in Basan, to the stream Of utmost Arnon. Nor content with such Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart Of Solomon he led by fraud to build His Temple right against the Temple of God On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove The pleasant Vally of Hinnom, Tophet thence And black Gehenna call\u2019d, the Type of Hell. Next Chemos, th\u2019 obscene dread of Moabs Sons, From Aroer to Nebo, and the wild Of Southmost Abarim; in Hesebon And Heronaim, Seons Realm, beyond The flowry Dale of Sibma clad with Vines, And Eleale to th\u2019 Asphaltick Pool. Peor his other Name, when he entic\u2019d Israel in Sittim on their march from Nile To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe. Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg\u2019d Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate; Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell. With these came they, who from the bordring flood Of old Euphrates to the Brook that parts Egypt from Syrian ground, had general Names Of Baalim and Ashtaroth, those male, These Feminine. For Spirits when they please Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft And uncompounded is their Essence pure, Not ti\u2019d or manacl\u2019d with joynt or limb, Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones, Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose Dilated or condens\u2019t, bright or obscure, Can execute their aerie purposes, And works of love or enmity fulfill. For those the Race of Israel oft forsook Their living strength, and unfrequented left His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low Bow\u2019d down in Battel, sunk before the Spear Of despicable foes. With these in troop Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians call\u2019d Astarte, Queen of Heav\u2019n, with crescent Horns; To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon Sidonian Virgins paid their Vows and Songs, In Sion also not unsung, where stood Her Temple on th\u2019 offensive Mountain, built By that uxorious King, whose heart though large, Beguil\u2019d by fair Idolatresses, fell To Idols foul. Thammuz came next behind, Whose annual wound in Lebanon allur\u2019d The Syrian Damsels to lament his fate In amorous dittyes all a Summers day, While smooth Adonis from his native Rock Ran purple to the Sea, suppos\u2019d with blood Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the Love-tale Infected Sions daughters with like heat, Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch Ezekiel saw, when by the Vision led His eye survay\u2019d the dark Idolatries Of alienated Judah. Next came one Who mourn\u2019d in earnest, when the Captive Ark Maim\u2019d his brute Image, head and hands lopt off In", "his own Temple, on the grunsel edge, Where he fell flat, and sham\u2019d his Worshipers: Dagon his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high Rear\u2019d in Azotus, dreaded through the Coast Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon, And Accaron and Gaza\u2019s frontier bounds. Him follow\u2019d Rimmon, whose delightful Seat Was fair Damscus, on the fertil Banks Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams. He also against the house of God was bold: A Leper once he lost and gain\u2019d a King, Ahaz his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew Gods Altar to disparage and displace For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn His odious offrings, and adore the Gods Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear\u2019d A crew who under Names of old Renown, Osiris, Isis, Orus and their Train With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus\u2019d Fanatic Egypt and her Priests, to seek Thir wandring Gods disguis\u2019d in brutish forms Rather then human. Nor did Israel scape Th\u2019 infection when their borrow\u2019d Gold compos\u2019d The Calf in Oreb: and the Rebel King Doubl\u2019d that sin in Bethel and in Dan, Lik\u2019ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox, Jehovah, who in one Night when he pass\u2019d From Egypt marching, equal\u2019d with one stroke Both her first born and all her bleating Gods. Belial came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood Or Altar smoak\u2019d; yet who more oft then hee In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest Turns Atheist, as did Ely\u2019s Sons, who fill\u2019d With lust and violence the house of God. In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs, And injury and outrage: And when Night Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine. Witness the Streets of Sodom, and that night In Gibeah, when hospitable Dores Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape. These were the prime in order and in might; The rest were long to tell, though far renown\u2019d, Th\u2019 Ionian Gods, of Javans Issue held Gods, yet confest later then Heav\u2019n and Earth Thir boasted Parents; Titan Heav\u2019ns first born With his enormous brood, and birthright seis\u2019d By younger Saturn, he from mightier Jove His own and Rhea\u2019s Son like measure found; So Jove usurping reign\u2019d: these first in Creet And Ida known, thence on the Snowy top Of cold Olympus rul\u2019d the middle Air Thir highest Heav\u2019n; or on the Delphian Cliff, Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds Of Doric Land; or who with Saturn old Fled over Adria to th\u2019 Hesperian Fields, And ore the Celtic roam\u2019d the utmost Isles. All these and more came flocking; but with looks Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear\u2019d Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost In", "loss it self; which on his count\u2019nance cast Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais\u2019d Their fainted courage, and dispel\u2019d their fears. Then strait commands that at the warlike sound Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim\u2019d Azazel as his right, a Cherube tall: Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld Th\u2019 Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc\u2019t Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz\u2019d, Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds: At which the universal Host upsent A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond Frighted the Reign of Chaos and old Night. All in a moment through the gloom were seen Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air With Orient Colours waving: with them rose A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms Appear\u2019d, and serried Shields in thick array Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move In perfect Phalanx to the Dorian mood Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais\u2019d To highth of noblest temper Hero\u2019s old Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage Deliberate valour breath\u2019d, firm and unmov\u2019d With dread of death to flight or foul retreat, Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage With solemn touches, troubl\u2019d thoughts, and chase Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they Breathing united force with fixed thought Mov\u2019d on in silence to soft Pipes that charm\u2019d Thir painful steps o\u2019re the burnt soyle; and now Advanc\u2019t in view they stand, a horrid Front Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise Of Warriers old with order\u2019d Spear and Shield, Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief Had to impose: He through the armed Files Darts his experienc\u2019t eye, and soon traverse The whole Battalion views, thir order due, Thir visages and stature as of Gods, Thir number last he summs. And now his heart Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength Glories: For never since created man, Met such imbodied force, as nam\u2019d with these Could merit more then that small infantry Warr\u2019d on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood Of Phlegra with th\u2019 Heroic Race were joyn\u2019d That fought at Theb\u2019s and Ilium, on each side Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds In Fable or Romance of Uthers Son Begirt with British and Armoric Knights; And all who since, Baptiz\u2019d or Infidel Jousted in Aspramont or Montalban, Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond, Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore When Charlemain with all his Peerage fell By Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyond Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ\u2019d Thir dread Commander: he above the rest In shape and gesture proudly eminent Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost All her Original brightness, nor appear\u2019d Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th\u2019 excess Of Glory obscur\u2019d: As when", "the Sun new ris\u2019n Looks through the Horizontal misty Air Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds On half the Nations, and with fear of change Perplexes Monarchs. Dark\u2019n\u2019d so, yet shon Above them all th\u2019 Arch Angel: but his face Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast Signs of remorse and passion to behold The fellows of his crime, the followers rather (Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn\u2019d For ever now to have their lot in pain, Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc\u2019t Of Heav\u2019n, and from Eternal Splendors flung For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood, Thir Glory witherd. As when Heavens Fire Hath scath\u2019d the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines, With singed top their stately growth though bare Stands on the blasted Heath. He now prepar\u2019d To speak; whereat their doubl\u2019d Ranks they bend From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round With all his Peers: attention held them mute. Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn, Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last Words interwove with sighs found out their way. O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers Matchless, but with th\u2019 Almighty, and that strife Was not inglorious, though th\u2019 event was dire, As this place testifies, and this dire change Hateful to utter: but what power of mind Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth Of knowledge past or present, could have fear\u2019d, How such united force of Gods, how such As stood like these, could ever know repulse? For who can yet beleeve, though after loss, That all these puissant Legions, whose exile Hath emptied Heav\u2019n, shall faile to re-ascend Self-rais\u2019d, and repossess their native seat. For me, be witness all the Host of Heav\u2019n, If counsels different, or danger shun\u2019d By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns Monarch in Heav\u2019n, till then as one secure Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute, Consent or custome, and his Regal State Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal\u2019d, Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall. Henceforth his might we know, and know our own So as not either to provoke, or dread New warr, provok\u2019t; our better part remains To work in close design, by fraud or guile What force effected not: that he no less At length from us may find, who overcomes By force, hath overcome but half his foe. Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife There went a fame in Heav\u2019n that he ere long Intended to create, and therein plant A generation, whom his choice regard Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven: Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere: For this Infernal Pit shall never hold Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th\u2019 Abysse Long under", "darkness cover. But these thoughts Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird, For who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr Open or understood must be resolv\u2019d. He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze Far round illumin\u2019d hell: highly they rag\u2019d Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm\u2019s Clash\u2019d on their sounding shields the din of war, Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav\u2019n. There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top Belch\u2019d fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign That in his womb was hid metallic Ore, The work of Sulphur. Thither wing\u2019d with speed A numerous Brigad hasten\u2019d. As when bands Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm\u2019d Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field, Or cast a Rampart. Mammon led them on, Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell From heav\u2019n, for ev\u2019n in heav\u2019n his looks & thoughts Were always downward bent, admiring more The riches of Heav\u2019ns pavement, trod\u2019n Gold, Then aught divine or holy else enjoy\u2019d In vision beatific: by him first Men also, and by his suggestion taught, Ransack\u2019d the Center, and with impious hands Rifl\u2019d the bowels of thir mother Earth For Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew Op\u2019nd into the Hill a spacious wound And dig\u2019d out ribs of Gold. Let none admire That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best Deserve the pretious bane. And here let those Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell Of Babel, and the works of Memphian Kings, Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame, And Strength and Art are easily outdone By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour What in an age they with incessant toyle And hands innumerable scarce perform Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar\u2019d, That underneath had veins of liquid fire Sluc\u2019d from the Lake, a second multitude With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore, Severing each kinde, and scum\u2019d the Bullion dross: A third as soon had form\u2019d within the ground A various mould, and from the boyling cells By strange conveyance fill\u2019d each hollow nook, As in an Organ from one blast of wind To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths. Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet, Built like a Temple, where Pilasters round Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid With Golden Architrave; nor did there want Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav\u2019n, The Roof was fretted Gold. Not Babilon, Nor great Alcairo such magnificence Equal\u2019d in all thir glories, to inshrine Belus or Serapis thir Gods, or seat Thir Kings, when Aegypt with Assyria strove In wealth and luxurie. Th\u2019 ascending pile Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores Op\u2019ning thir brazen foulds discover wide Within, her ample spaces, o\u2019re the smooth And level pavement: from the arched roof", "Pendant by suttle Magic many a row Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed With Naphtha and Asphaltus yeilded light As from a sky. The hasty multitude Admiring enter\u2019d, and the work some praise And some the Architect: his hand was known In Heav\u2019n by many a Towred structure high, Where Scepter\u2019d Angels held thir residence, And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King Exalted to such power, and gave to rule, Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright. Nor was his name unheard or unador\u2019d In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land Men call\u2019d him Mulciber; and how he fell From Heav\u2019n, they fabl\u2019d, thrown by angry Jove Sheer o\u2019re the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve, A Summers day; and with the setting Sun Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star, On Lemnos th\u2019 Aegaean Ile: thus they relate, Erring; for he with this rebellious rout Fell long before; nor aught avail\u2019d him now To have built in Heav\u2019n high Towrs; nor did he scape By all his Engins, but was headlong sent With his industrious crew to build in hell. Mean while the winged Haralds by command Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim A solemn Councel forthwith to be held At Pandaemonium, the high Capital Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call\u2019d From every and Band squared Regiment By place or choice the worthiest; they anon With hundreds and with thousands trooping came Attended: all access was throng\u2019d, the Gates And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall (Though like a cover\u2019d field, where Champions bold Wont ride in arm\u2019d, and at the Soldans chair Defi\u2019d the best of Panim chivalry To mortal combat or carreer with Lance) Thick swarm\u2019d, both on the ground and in the air, Brusht with the hiss of russling wings. As Bees In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides, Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank, The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel, New rub\u2019d with Baume, expatiate and confer Thir State affairs. So thick the aerie crowd Swarm\u2019d and were straitn\u2019d; till the Signal giv\u2019n, Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race Beyond the Indian Mount, or Faerie Elves, Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees, Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth & dance Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear; At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds. Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms Reduc\u2019d thir shapes immense, and were at large, Though without number still amidst the Hall Of that infernal Court. But far within And in", "thir own dimensions like themselves The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim In close recess and secret conclave sat A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat\u2019s, Frequent and full. After short silence then And summons read, the great consult began. THE END OF THE FIRST BOOK. PARADISE LOST BOOK II. High on a Throne of Royal State, which far Outshon the wealth of Ormus and of Ind, Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand Showrs on her Kings Barbaric Pearl & Gold, Satan exalted sat, by merit rais\u2019d To that bad eminence; and from despair Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue Vain Warr with Heav\u2019n, and by success untaught His proud imaginations thus displaid. Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heav\u2019n, For since no deep within her gulf can hold Immortal vigor, though opprest and fall\u2019n, I give not Heav\u2019n for lost. From this descent Celestial vertues rising, will appear More glorious and more dread then from no fall, And trust themselves to fear no second fate: Mee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav\u2019n Did first create your Leader, next, free choice, With what besides, in Counsel or in Fight, Hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss Thus farr at least recover\u2019d, hath much more Establisht in a safe unenvied Throne Yeilded with full consent. The happier state In Heav\u2019n, which follows dignity, might draw Envy from each inferior; but who here Will envy whom the highest place exposes Formost to stand against the Thunderers aime Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share Of endless pain? where there is then no good For which to strive, no strife can grow up there From Faction; for none sure will claim in hell Precedence, none, whose portion is so small Of present pain, that with ambitious mind Will covet more. With this advantage then To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord, More then can be in Heav\u2019n, we now return To claim our just inheritance of old, Surer to prosper then prosperity Could have assur\u2019d us; and by what best way, Whether of open Warr or covert guile, We now debate; who can advise, may speak. He ceas\u2019d, and next him Moloc, Scepter\u2019d King Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit That fought in Heav\u2019n; now fiercer by despair: His trust was with th\u2019 Eternal to be deem\u2019d Equal in strength, and rather then be less Car\u2019d not to be at all; with that care lost Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse He reckd not, and these words thereafter spake. My sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles, More unexpert, I boast not: them let those Contrive who need, or when they need, not now. For while they sit contriving, shall the rest, Millions that stand in Arms, and longing wait The Signal to ascend, sit lingring here Heav\u2019ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place Accept this dark opprobrious Den of shame, The Prison of his Tyranny who", "Reigns By our delay? no, let us rather choose Arm\u2019d with Hell flames and fury all at once O\u2019re Heav\u2019ns high Towrs to force resistless way, Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise Of his Almighty Engin he shall hear Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning see Black fire and horror shot with equal rage Among his Angels; and his Throne it self Mixt with Tartarean Sulphur, and strange fire, His own invented Torments. But perhaps The way seems difficult and steep to scale With upright wing against a higher foe. Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench Of that forgetful Lake benumme not still, That in our proper motion we ascend Up to our native seat: descent and fall To us is adverse. Who but felt of late When the fierce Foe hung on our brok\u2019n Rear Insulting, and pursu\u2019d us through the Deep, With what compulsion and laborious flight We sunk thus low? Th\u2019 ascent is easie then; Th\u2019 event is fear\u2019d; should we again provoke Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find To our destruction: if there be in Hell Fear to be worse destroy\u2019d: what can be worse Then to dwell here, driv\u2019n out from bliss, condemn\u2019d In this abhorred deep to utter woe; Where pain of unextinguishable fire Must exercise us without hope of end The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge Inexorably, and the torturing houre Calls us to Penance? More destroy\u2019d then thus We should be quite abolisht and expire. What fear we then? what doubt we to incense His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag\u2019d, Will either quite consume us, and reduce To nothing this essential, happier farr Then miserable to have eternal being: Or if our substance be indeed Divine, And cannot cease to be, we are at worst On this side nothing; and by proof we feel Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav\u2019n, And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme, Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne: Which if not Victory is yet Revenge. He ended frowning, and his look denounc\u2019d Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous To less then Gods. On th\u2019 other side up rose Belial, in act more graceful and humane; A fairer person lost not Heav\u2019n; he seemd For dignity compos\u2019d and high exploit: But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear The better reason, to perplex and dash Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low; To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas\u2019d the eare, And with perswasive accent thus began. I should be much for open Warr, O Peers, As not behind in hate; if what was urg\u2019d Main reason to perswade immediate Warr, Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast Ominous conjecture on the whole success: When he who most excels in fact of Arms, In what he counsels and in what excels Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair", "And utter dissolution, as the scope Of all his aim, after some dire revenge. First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav\u2019n are fill\u2019d With Armed watch, that render all access Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night, Scorning surprize. Or could we break our way By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise With blackest Insurrection, to confound Heav\u2019ns purest Light, yet our great Enemie All incorruptible would on his Throne Sit unpolluted, and th\u2019 Ethereal mould Incapable of stain would soon expel Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire Victorious. Thus repuls\u2019d, our final hope Is flat despair: we must exasperate Th\u2019 Almighty Victor to spend all his rage, And that must end us, that must be our cure, To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose, Though full of pain, this intellectual being, Those thoughts that wander through Eternity, To perish rather, swallowd up and lost In the wide womb of uncreated night, Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows, Let this be good, whether our angry Foe Can give it, or will ever? how he can Is doubtful; that he never will is sure. Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, Belike through impotence, or unaware, To give his Enemies thir wish, and end Them in his anger, whom his anger saves To punish endless? wherefore cease we then? Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed, Reserv\u2019d and destin\u2019d to Eternal woe; Whatever doing, what can we suffer more, What can we suffer worse? is this then worst, Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms? What when we fled amain, pursu\u2019d and strook With Heav\u2019ns afflicting Thunder, and besought The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem\u2019d A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay Chain\u2019d on the burning Lake? that sure was worse. What if the breath that kindl\u2019d those grim fires Awak\u2019d should blow them into sevenfold rage And plunge us in the Flames? or from above Should intermitted vengeance Arme again His red right hand to plague us? what if all Her stores were op\u2019n\u2019d, and this Firmament Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire, Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall One day upon our heads; while we perhaps Designing or exhorting glorious Warr, Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl\u2019d Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains; There to converse with everlasting groans, Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd, Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse. Warr therefore, open or conceal\u2019d, alike My voice disswades; for what can force or guile With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye Views all things at one view? he from heav\u2019ns highth All these our motions vain, sees and derides; Not more Almighty to resist our might Then wise to frustrate all our", "plots and wiles. Shall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav\u2019n Thus trampl\u2019d, thus expell\u2019d to suffer here Chains & these Torments? better these then worse By my advice; since fate inevitable Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree, The Victors will. To suffer, as to doe, Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust That so ordains: this was at first resolv\u2019d, If we were wise, against so great a foe Contending, and so doubtful what might fall. I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold And vent\u2019rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear What yet they know must follow, to endure Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain, The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, Our Supream Foe in time may much remit His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov\u2019d Not mind us not offending, satisfi\u2019d With what is punish\u2019t; whence these raging fires Will slack\u2019n, if his breath stir not thir flames. Our purer essence then will overcome Thir noxious vapour, or enur\u2019d not feel, Or chang\u2019d at length, and to the place conformd In temper and in nature, will receive Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain; This horror will grow milde, this darkness light, Besides what hope the never-ending flight Of future days may bring, what chance, what change Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers For happy though but ill, for ill not worst, If we procure not to our selves more woe. Thus Belial with words cloath\u2019d in reasons garb Counsel\u2019d ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath, Not peace: and after him thus Mammon spake. Either to disinthrone the King of Heav\u2019n We warr, if warr be best, or to regain Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeild To fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife: The former vain to hope argues as vain The latter: for what place can be for us Within Heav\u2019ns bound, unless Heav\u2019ns Lord supream We overpower? Suppose he should relent And publish Grace to all, on promise made Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we Stand in his presence humble, and receive Strict Laws impos\u2019d, to celebrate his Throne With warbl\u2019d Hymns, and to his Godhead sing Forc\u2019t Halleluiah\u2019s; while he Lordly sits Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers, Our servile offerings. This must be our task In Heav\u2019n, this our delight; how wearisom Eternity so spent in worship paid To whom we hate. Let us not then pursue By force impossible, by leave obtain\u2019d Unacceptable, though in Heav\u2019n, our state Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek Our own good from our selves, and from our own Live to our selves, though in this vast recess, Free, and to none accountable, preferring Hard liberty before the easie yoke Of servile Pomp. Our greatness will appear Then most conspicuous, when great things of small, Useful of hurtful, prosperous of", "adverse We can create, and in what place so e\u2019re Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain Through labour and endurance. This deep world Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst Thick clouds and dark doth Heav\u2019ns all-ruling Sire Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur\u2019d, And with the Majesty of darkness round Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar Must\u2019ring thir rage, and Heav\u2019n resembles Hell? As he our Darkness, cannot we his Light Imitate when we please? This Desart soile Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold; Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise Magnificence; and what can Heav\u2019n shew more? Our torments also may in length of time Become our Elements, these piercing Fires As soft as now severe, our temper chang\u2019d Into their temper; which must needs remove The sensible of pain. All things invite To peaceful Counsels, and the settl\u2019d State Of order, how in safety best we may Compose our present evils, with regard Of what we are and where, dismissing quite All thoughts of Warr: ye have what I advise. He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld Th\u2019 Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain The sound of blustring winds, which all night long Had rous\u2019d the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay After the Tempest: Such applause was heard As Mammon ended, and his Sentence pleas\u2019d, Advising peace: for such another Field They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear Of Thunder and the Sword of Michael Wrought still within them; and no less desire To found this nether Empire, which might rise By pollicy, and long process of time, In emulation opposite to Heav\u2019n. Which when Beelzebub perceiv\u2019d, then whom, Satan except, none higher sat, with grave Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem\u2019d A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven Deliberation sat and publick care; And Princely counsel in his face yet shon, Majestick though in ruin: sage he stood With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look Drew audience and attention still as Night Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake. Thrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heav\u2019n, Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now Must we renounce, and changing stile be call\u2019d Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote Inclines, here to continue, and build up here A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream, And know not that the King of Heav\u2019n hath doom\u2019d This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt From Heav\u2019ns high jurisdiction, in new League Banded against his Throne, but to remaine In strictest bondage, though thus far remov\u2019d, Under th\u2019 inevitable curb, reserv\u2019d His captive multitude: For he, be sure, In highth or depth, still first and last will Reign Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part By our revolt, but over Hell", "extend His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav\u2019n. What sit we then projecting Peace and Warr? Warr hath determin\u2019d us, and foild with loss Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none Voutsaf\u2019t or sought; for what peace will be giv\u2019n To us enslav\u2019d, but custody severe, And stripes, and arbitrary punishment Inflicted? and what peace can we return, But to our power hostility and hate, Untam\u2019d reluctance, and revenge though slow, Yet ever plotting how the Conquerour least May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce In doing what we most in suffering feel? Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need With dangerous expedition to invade Heav\u2019n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege, Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find Some easier enterprize? There is a place (If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav\u2019n Err not) another World, the happy seat Of som new Race call\u2019d Man, about this time To be created like to us, though less In power and excellence, but favour\u2019d more Of him who rules above; so was his will Pronounc\u2019d among the Gods, and by an Oath, That shook Heav\u2019ns whol circumference, confirm\u2019d. Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn What creatures there inhabit, of what mould, Or substance, how endu\u2019d, and what thir Power, And where thir weakness, how attempted best, By force or suttlety: Though Heav\u2019n be shut, And Heav\u2019ns high Arbitrator sit secure In his own strength, this place may lye expos\u2019d The utmost border of his Kingdom, left To their defence who hold it: here perhaps Som advantagious act may be achiev\u2019d By sudden onset, either with Hell fire To waste his whole Creation, or possess All as our own, and drive as we were driven, The punie habitants, or if not drive, Seduce them to our Party, that thir God May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand Abolish his own works. This would surpass Common revenge, and interrupt his joy In our Confusion, and our Joy upraise In his disturbance; when his darling Sons Hurl\u2019d headlong to partake with us, shall curse Thir frail Originals, and faded bliss, Faded so soon. Advise if this be worth Attempting, or to sit in darkness here Hatching vain Empires. Thus Beelzebub Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis\u2019d By Satan, and in part propos\u2019d: for whence, But from the Author of all ill could Spring So deep a malice, to confound the race Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell To mingle and involve, done all to spite The great Creatour? But thir spite still serves His glory to augment. The bold design Pleas\u2019d highly those infernal States, and joy Sparkl\u2019d in all thir eyes; with full assent They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews. Well have ye judg\u2019d, well ended long debate, Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are, Great things resolv\u2019d; which from the lowest deep Will once more lift us", "up, in spight of Fate, Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms And opportune excursion we may chance Re-enter Heav\u2019n; or else in some milde Zone Dwell not unvisited of Heav\u2019ns fair Light Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air, To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires Shall breath her balme. But first whom shall we send In search of this new world, whom shall we find Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet The dark unbottom\u2019d infinite Abyss And through the palpable obscure find out His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight Upborn with indefatigable wings Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick Of Angels watching round? Here he had need All circumspection, and we now no less Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send, The weight of all and our last hope relies. This said, he sat; and expectation held His look suspence, awaiting who appeer\u2019d To second, or oppose, or undertake The perilous attempt: but all sat mute, Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; & each In others count\u2019nance red his own dismay Astonisht: none among the choice and prime Of those Heav\u2019n-warring Champions could be found So hardie as to proffer or accept Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last Satan, whom now transcendent glory rais\u2019d Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride Conscious of highest worth, unmov\u2019d thus spake. O Progeny of Heav\u2019n, Empyreal Thrones, With reason hath deep silence and demurr Seis\u2019d us, though undismaid: long is the way And hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light; Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire, Outrageous to devour, immures us round Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant Barr\u2019d over us prohibit all egress. These past, if any pass, the void profound Of unessential Night receives him next Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being Threatens him, plung\u2019d in that abortive gulf. If thence he scape into what ever world, Or unknown Region, what remains him less Then unknown dangers and as hard escape. But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers, And this Imperial Sov\u2019ranty, adorn\u2019d With splendor, arm\u2019d with power, if aught propos\u2019d And judg\u2019d of public moment, in the shape Of difficulty or danger could deterre Me from attempting. Wherefore do I assume These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign, Refusing to accept as great a share Of hazard as of honour, due alike To him who Reigns, and so much to him due Of hazard more, as he above the rest High honourd sits? Go therfore mighty powers, Terror of Heav\u2019n, though fall\u2019n; intend at home, While here shall be our home, what best may ease The present misery, and render Hell More tollerable; if there be cure or charm To respite or deceive, or", "slack the pain Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek Deliverance for us all: this enterprize None shall partake with me. Thus saying rose The Monarch, and prevented all reply, Prudent, least from his resolution rais\u2019d Others among the chief might offer now (Certain to be refus\u2019d) what erst they feard; And so refus\u2019d might in opinion stand His rivals, winning cheap the high repute Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they Dreaded not more th\u2019 adventure then his voice Forbidding; and at once with him they rose; Thir rising all at once was as the sound Of Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend With awful reverence prone; and as a God Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav\u2019n: Nor fail\u2019d they to express how much they prais\u2019d, That for the general safety he despis\u2019d His own: for neither do the Spirits damn\u2019d Loose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, Or close ambition varnisht o\u2019re with zeal. Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief: As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o\u2019respread Heav\u2019ns chearful face, the lowring Element Scowls ore the dark\u2019nd lantskip Snow, or showre; If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet Extend his ev\u2019ning beam, the fields revive, The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. O shame to men! Devil with Devil damn\u2019d Firm concord holds, men onely disagree Of Creatures rational, though under hope Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace, Yet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife Among themselves, and levie cruel warres, Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy: As if (which might induce us to accord) Man had not hellish foes anow besides, That day and night for his destruction waite. The Stygian Councel thus dissolv\u2019d; and forth In order came the grand infernal Peers, Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd Alone th\u2019 Antagonist of Heav\u2019n, nor less Then Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream, And God-like imitated State; him round A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos\u2019d With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms. Then of thir Session ended they bid cry With Trumpets regal sound the great result: Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie By Haralds voice explain\u2019d: the hollow Abyss Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell With deafning shout, return\u2019d them loud acclaim. Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais\u2019d By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers Disband, and wandring, each his several way Pursues, as inclination or sad choice Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain The irksome hours, till his great Chief return. Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime Upon the wing, or in", "swift race contend, As at th\u2019 Olympian Games or Pythian fields; Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form. As when to warn proud Cities warr appears Wag\u2019d in the troubl\u2019d Skie, and Armies rush To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van Pric forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spears Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms From either end of Heav\u2019n the welkin burns. Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. As when Alcides from Oealia Crown\u2019d With conquest, felt th\u2019 envenom\u2019d robe, and tore Through pain up by the roots Thessalian Pines, And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw Into th\u2019 Euboic Sea. Others more milde, Retreated in a silent valley, sing With notes Angelical to many a Harp Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance. Thir song was partial, but the harmony (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet (For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,) Others apart sat on a Hill retir\u2019d, In thoughts more elevate, and reason\u2019d high Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate, Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute, And found no end, in wandring mazes lost. Of good and evil much they argu\u2019d then, Of happiness and final misery, Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame, Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie: Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm Pain for a while or anguish, and excite Fallacious hope, or arm th\u2019 obdured brest With stubborn patience as with triple steel. Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands, On bold adventure to discover wide That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps Might yeild them easier habitation, bend Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams; Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate, Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep; Cocytus, nam\u2019d of lamentation loud Heard on the ruful stream; fierce Phlegeton Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. Farr off from these a slow and silent stream, Lethe the River of Oblivion roules Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks, Forthwith his former state and being forgets, Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. Beyond this flood a frozen Continent Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, A gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog Betwixt Damiata and mount Casius old, Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air Burns frore, and cold performs th\u2019 effect of Fire. Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail\u2019d, At certain revolutions all the damn\u2019d Are brought: and", "feel by turns the bitter change Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce, From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine Immovable, infixt, and frozen round, Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire. They ferry over this Lethean Sound Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment, And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, All in one moment, and so neer the brink; But fate withstands, and to oppose th\u2019 attempt Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards The Ford, and of it self the water flies All taste of living wight, as once it fled The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on In confus\u2019d march forlorn, th\u2019 adventrous Bands With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast View\u2019d first thir lamentable lot, and found No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile They pass\u2019d, and many a Region dolorous, O\u2019re many a Frozen, many a Fierie Alpe, Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death, A Universe of death, which God by curse Created evil, for evil only good, Where all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds, Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, Abominable, inutterable, and worse Then Fables yet have feign\u2019d, or fear conceiv\u2019d, Gorgons and Hydra\u2019s, and Chimera\u2019s dire. Mean while the Adversary of God and Man, Satan with thoughts inflam\u2019d of highest design, Puts on swift wings, and toward the Gates of Hell Explores his solitary flight; som times He scours the right hand coast, som times the left, Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares Up to the fiery concave touring high. As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri\u2019d Hangs in the Clouds, by Aequinoctial Winds Close sailing from Bengala, or the Iles Of Ternate and Tidore, whence Merchants bring Thir spicie Drugs: they on the trading Flood Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole. So seem\u2019d Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof, And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock, Impenitrable, impal\u2019d with circling fire, Yet unconsum\u2019d. Before the Gates there sat On either side a formidable shape; The one seem\u2019d Woman to the waste, and fair, But ended foul in many a scaly fould Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm\u2019d With mortal sting: about her middle round A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark\u2019d With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep, If aught disturb\u2019d thir noyse, into her woomb, And kennel there, yet there still bark\u2019d and howl\u2019d Within unseen. Farr less abhorrd then these Vex\u2019d Scylla bathing in the Sea that parts Calabria from the hoarce Trinacrian shore: Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call\u2019d In secret, riding through the Air she comes Lur\u2019d", "with the smell of infant blood, to dance With Lapland Witches, while the labouring Moon Eclipses at thir charms. The other shape, If shape it might be call\u2019d that shape had none Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb, Or substance might be call\u2019d that shadow seem\u2019d, For each seem\u2019d either; black it stood as Night, Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell, And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem\u2019d his head The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on. Satan was now at hand, and from his seat The Monster moving onward came as fast, With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode. Th\u2019 undaunted Fiend what this might be admir\u2019d, Admir\u2019d, not fear\u2019d; God and his Son except, Created thing naught vallu\u2019d he nor shun\u2019d; And with disdainful look thus first began. Whence and what art thou, execrable shape, That dar\u2019st, though grim and terrible, advance Thy miscreated Front athwart my way To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass, That be assur\u2019d, without leave askt of thee: Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav\u2019n. To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply\u2019d, Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee, Who first broke peace in Heav\u2019n and Faith, till then Unbrok\u2019n, and in proud rebellious Arms Drew after him the third part of Heav\u2019ns Sons Conjur\u2019d against the highest, for which both Thou And they outcast from God, are here condemn\u2019d To waste Eternal daies in woe and pain? And reck\u2019n\u2019st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav\u2019n, Hell-doomd, and breath\u2019st defiance here and scorn, Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more, Thy King and Lord? Back to thy punishment, False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings, Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before. So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape, So speaking and so threatning, grew ten fold More dreadful and deform: on th\u2019 other side Incenc\u2019t with indignation Satan stood Unterrifi\u2019d, and like a Comet burn\u2019d, That fires the length of Ophiucus huge In th\u2019 Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair Shakes Pestilence and Warr. Each at the Head Level\u2019d his deadly aime; thir fatall hands No second stroke intend, and such a frown Each cast at th\u2019 other, as when two black Clouds With Heav\u2019ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on Over the Caspian, then stand front to front Hov\u2019ring a space, till Winds the signal blow To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air: So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood; For never but once more was either like To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds Had been achiev\u2019d, whereof all Hell had rung, Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key, Ris\u2019n, and with hideous outcry rush\u2019d between. O Father,", "what intends thy hand, she cry\u2019d, Against thy only Son? What fury O Son, Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart Against thy Fathers head? and know\u2019st for whom; For him who sits above and laughs the while At thee ordain\u2019d his drudge, to execute What e\u2019re his wrath, which he calls Justice, bids, His wrath which one day will destroy ye both. She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest Forbore, then these to her Satan return\u2019d: So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange Thou interposest, that my sudden hand Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds What it intends; till first I know of thee, What thing thou art, thus double-form\u2019d, and why In this infernal Vaile first met thou call\u2019st Me Father, and that Fantasm call\u2019st my Son? I know thee not, nor ever saw till now Sight more detestable then him and thee. T\u2019 whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply\u2019d; Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem Now in thine eye so foul, once deemd so fair In Heav\u2019n, when at th\u2019 Assembly, and in sight Of all the Seraphim with thee combin\u2019d In bold conspiracy against Heav\u2019ns King, All on a sudden miserable pain Surpris\u2019d thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast Threw forth, till on the left side op\u2019ning wide, Likest to thee in shape and count\u2019nance bright, Then shining heav\u2019nly fair, a Goddess arm\u2019d Out of thy head I sprung: amazement seis\u2019d All th\u2019 Host of Heav\u2019n; back they recoild affraid At first, and call\u2019d me Sin, and for a Sign Portentous held me; but familiar grown, I pleas\u2019d, and with attractive graces won The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing Becam\u2019st enamour\u2019d, and such joy thou took\u2019st With me in secret, that my womb conceiv\u2019d A growing burden. Mean while Warr arose, And fields were fought in Heav\u2019n; wherein remaind (For what could else) to our Almighty Foe Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout Through all the Empyrean: down they fell Driv\u2019n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down Into this Deep, and in the general fall I also; at which time this powerful Key Into my hand was giv\u2019n, with charge to keep These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass Without my op\u2019ning. Pensive here I sat Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. At last this odious offspring whom thou seest Thine own begotten, breaking violent way Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew Transform\u2019d: but he my inbred enemie Forth issu\u2019d, brandishing his fatal Dart Made to destroy: I fled, and cry\u2019d out Death; Hell trembl\u2019d at the hideous Name, and sigh\u2019d From all her Caves, and back resounded Death. I fled, but he pursu\u2019d", "(though more, it seems, Inflam\u2019d with lust then rage) and swifter far, Me overtook his mother all dismaid, And in embraces forcible and foule Ingendring with me, of that rape begot These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv\u2019d And hourly born, with sorrow infinite To me, for when they list into the womb That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw My Bowels, their repast; then bursting forth Afresh with conscious terrours vex me round, That rest or intermission none I find. Before mine eyes in opposition sits Grim Death my Son and foe, who sets them on, And me his Parent would full soon devour For want of other prey, but that he knows His end with mine involvd; and knows that I Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane, When ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc\u2019d. But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope To be invulnerable in those bright Arms, Though temper\u2019d heav\u2019nly, for that mortal dint, Save he who reigns above, none can resist. She finish\u2019d, and the suttle Fiend his lore Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth. Dear Daughter, since thou claim\u2019st me for thy Sire, And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge Of dalliance had with thee in Heav\u2019n, and joys Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know I come no enemie, but to set free From out this dark and dismal house of pain, Both him and thee, and all the heav\u2019nly Host Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm\u2019d Fell with us from on high: from them I go This uncouth errand sole, and one for all My self expose, with lonely steps to tread Th\u2019 unfounded deep, & through the void immense To search with wandring quest a place foretold Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now Created vast and round, a place of bliss In the Pourlieues of Heav\u2019n, and therein plac\u2019t A race of upstart Creatures, to supply Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov\u2019d, Least Heav\u2019n surcharg\u2019d with potent multitude Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught Then this more secret now design\u2019d, I haste To know, and this once known, shall soon return, And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm\u2019d With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill\u2019d Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey. He ceas\u2019d, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear His famine should be fill\u2019d, and blest his mawe Destin\u2019d to that good hour: no less rejoyc\u2019d His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire. The key of this infernal Pit by due, And by command of Heav\u2019ns all-powerful King I keep, by him forbidden to unlock These Adamantine Gates; against all force", "Death ready stands to interpose his dart, Fearless to be o\u2019rematcht by living might. But what ow I to his commands above Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down Into this gloom of Tartarus profound, To sit in hateful Office here confin\u2019d, Inhabitant of Heav\u2019n, and heav\u2019nlie-born, Here in perpetual agonie and pain, With terrors and with clamors compasst round Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed: Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou My being gav\u2019st me; whom should I obey But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon To that new world of light and bliss, among The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems Thy daughter and thy darling, without end. Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key, Sad instrument of all our woe, she took; And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train, Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew, Which but her self not all the Stygian powers Could once have mov\u2019d; then in the key-hole turns Th\u2019 intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease Unfast\u2019ns: on a sudden op\u2019n flie With impetuous recoile and jarring sound Th\u2019 infernal dores, and on thir hinges great Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook Of Erebus. She op\u2019nd, but to shut Excel\u2019d her power; the Gates wide op\u2019n stood, That with extended wings a Bannerd Host Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array; So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame. Before thir eyes in sudden view appear The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark Illimitable Ocean without bound, Without dimension, where length, breadth, and highth, And time and place are lost; where eldest Night And Chaos, Ancestors of Nature, hold Eternal Anarchie, amidst the noise Of endless warrs and by confusion stand. For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag Of each his faction, in thir several Clanns, Light-arm\u2019d or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow, Swarm populous, unnumber\u2019d as the Sands Of Barca or Cyrene\u2019s torrid soil, Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise Thir lighter wings. To whom these most adhere, Hee rules a moment; Chaos Umpire sits, And by decision more imbroiles the fray By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter Chance governs all. Into this wilde Abyss, The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave, Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire, But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt Confus\u2019dly, and which thus must ever fight, Unless th\u2019 Almighty Maker them ordain His dark materials to create more Worlds, Into this wilde Abyss the warie fiend Stood on the brink of Hell and look\u2019d a while, Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith He had to cross. Nor was his", "eare less peal\u2019d With noises loud and ruinous (to compare Great things with small) then when Bellona storms, With all her battering Engines bent to rase Som Capital City, or less then if this frame Of Heav\u2019n were falling, and these Elements In mutinie had from her Axle torn The stedfast Earth. At last his Sail-broad Vannes He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets A vast vacuitie: all unawares Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour Down had been falling, had not by ill chance The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him As many miles aloft: that furie stay\u2019d, Quencht in a Boggie Syrtris, neither Sea, Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares, Treading the crude consistence, half on foot, Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile. As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale, Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stelth Had from his wakeful custody purloind The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, With head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way, And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes: At length a universal hubbub wilde Of stunning sounds and voices all confus\u2019d Born through the hollow dark assaults his eare With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes, Undaunted to meet there what ever power Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne Of Chaos, and his dark Pavilion spread Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron\u2019d Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things, The consort of his Reign; and by them stood Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name Of Demogorgon; Rumor next and Chance, And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild, And Discord with a thousand various mouths. T\u2019 whom Satan turning boldly, thus. Ye Powers And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss, Chaos and Ancient Night, I come no Spie, With purpose to explore or to disturb The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint Wandring this darksome desart, as my way Lies through your spacious Empire up to light, Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds Confine with Heav\u2019n; or if som other place From your Dominion won, th\u2019 Ethereal King Possesses lately, thither to arrive I travel this profound, direct my course; Directed, no mean recompence it brings To your behoof, if I that Region lost, All usurpation thence expell\u2019d, reduce To her original darkness and your sway (Which is my present journey) and once more Erect the Standerd there of Ancient Night; Yours be th\u2019 advantage all, mine the revenge. Thus", "Satan; and him thus the Anarch old With faultring speech and visage incompos\u2019d Answer\u2019d. I know thee, stranger, who thou art, That mighty leading Angel, who of late Made head against Heav\u2019ns King, though overthrown. I saw and heard, for such a numerous host Fled not in silence through the frighted deep With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, Confusion worse confounded; and Heav\u2019n Gates Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands Pursuing. I upon my Frontieres here Keep residence; if all I can will serve, That little which is left so to defend Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath; Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World Hung ore my Realm, link\u2019d in a golden Chain To that side Heav\u2019n from whence your Legions fell: If that way be your walk, you have not farr; So much the neerer danger; goe and speed; Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain. He ceas\u2019d; and Satan staid not to reply, But glad that now his Sea should find a shore, With fresh alacritie and force renew\u2019d Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock Of fighting Elements, on all sides round Environ\u2019d wins his way; harder beset And more endanger\u2019d, then when Argo pass\u2019d Through Bosporus betwixt the justling Rocks: Or when Ulysses on the Larbord shunnd Charybdis, and by th\u2019 other whirlpool steard. So he with difficulty and labour hard Mov\u2019d on, with difficulty and labour hee; But hee once past, soon after when man fell, Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain Following his track, such was the will of Heav\u2019n, Pav\u2019d after him a broad and beat\u2019n way Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf Tamely endur\u2019d a Bridge of wondrous length From Hell continu\u2019d reaching th\u2019 utmost Orbe Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse With easie intercourse pass to and fro To tempt or punish mortals, except whom God and good Angels guard by special grace. But now at last the sacred influence Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav\u2019n Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins Her fardest verge, and Chaos to retire As from her outmost works a brok\u2019n foe With tumult less and with less hostile din, That Satan with less toil, and now with ease Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn; Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air, Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold Farr off th\u2019 Empyreal Heav\u2019n, extended wide In circuit, undetermind square or round, With Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn\u2019d Of living Saphire, once his native Seat; And fast by hanging in a golden Chain This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon. Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge, Accurst,", "and in a cursed hour he hies. THE END OF THE SECOND BOOK. PARADISE LOST BOOK III. Hail holy light, ofspring of Heav\u2019n first- born, Or of th\u2019 Eternal Coeternal beam May I express thee unblam\u2019d? since God is light, And never but in unapproached light Dwelt from Eternitie, dwelt then in thee, Bright effluence of bright essence increate. Or hear\u2019st thou rather pure Ethereal stream, Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun, Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice Of God, as with a Mantle didst invest The rising world of waters dark and deep, Won from the void and formless infinite. Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing, Escap\u2019t the Stygian Pool, though long detain\u2019d In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight Through utter and through middle darkness borne With other notes then to th\u2019 Orphean Lyre I sung of Chaos and Eternal Night, Taught by the heav\u2019nly Muse to venture down The dark descent, and up to reascend, Though hard and rare: thee I revisit safe, And feel thy sovran vital Lamp; but thou Revisit\u2019st not these eyes, that rowle in vain To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn; So thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs, Or dim suffusion veild. Yet not the more Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt Cleer Spring, or shadie Grove, or Sunnie Hill, Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief Thee Sion and the flowrie Brooks beneath That wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow, Nightly I visit: nor somtimes forget Those other two equal\u2019d with me in Fate, So were I equal\u2019d with them in renown, Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides, And Tiresias and Phineus Prophets old. Then feed on thoughts, that voluntarie move Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful Bird Sings darkling, and in shadiest Covert hid Tunes her nocturnal Note. Thus with the Year Seasons return, but not to me returns Day, or the sweet approach of Ev\u2019n or Morn, Or sight of vernal bloom, or Summers Rose, Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine; But cloud in stead, and ever-during dark Surrounds me, from the chearful waies of men Cut off, and for the book of knowledg fair Presented with a Universal blanc Of Natures works to mee expung\u2019d and ras\u2019d, And wisdome at one entrance quite shut out. So much the rather thou Celestial light Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell Of things invisible to mortal sight. Now had the Almighty Father from above, From the pure Empyrean where he sits High Thron\u2019d above all highth, bent down his eye, His own works and their works at once to view: About him all the Sanctities of Heaven Stood thick as Starrs, and from his sight receiv\u2019d Beatitude past utterance; on his right The radiant image of his Glory sat, His onely Son; On Earth he", "first beheld Our two first Parents, yet the onely two Of mankind, in the happie Garden plac\u2019t, Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love, Uninterrupted joy, unrivald love In blissful solitude; he then survey\u2019d Hell and the Gulf between, and Satan there Coasting the wall of Heav\u2019n on this side Night In the dun Air sublime, and ready now To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet On the bare outside of this World, that seem\u2019d Firm land imbosom\u2019d without Firmament, Uncertain which, in Ocean or in Air. Him God beholding from his prospect high, Wherein past, present, future he beholds, Thus to his onely Son foreseeing spake. Onely begotten Son, seest thou what rage Transports our adversarie, whom no bounds Prescrib\u2019d, no barrs of Hell, nor all the chains Heapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss Wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems On desperat revenge, that shall redound Upon his own rebellious head. And now Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way Not farr off Heav\u2019n, in the Precincts of light, Directly towards the new created World, And Man there plac\u2019t, with purpose to assay If him by force he can destroy, or worse, By som false guile pervert; and shall pervert; For man will heark\u2019n to his glozing lyes, And easily transgress the sole Command, Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall Hee and his faithless Progenie: whose fault? Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee All he could have; I made him just and right, Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall. Such I created all th\u2019 Ethereal Powers And Spirits, both them who stood & them who faild; Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell. Not free, what proof could they have givn sincere Of true allegiance, constant Faith or Love, Where onely what they needs must do, appeard, Not what they would? what praise could they receive? What pleasure I from such obedience paid, When Will and Reason (Reason also is choice) Useless and vain, of freedom both despoild, Made passive both, had servd necessitie, Not mee. They therefore as to right belongd, So were created, nor can justly accuse Thir maker, or thir making, or thir Fate; As if Predestination over-rul\u2019d Thir will, dispos\u2019d by absolute Decree Or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed Thir own revolt, not I: if I foreknew, Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault, Which had no less prov\u2019d certain unforeknown. So without least impulse or shadow of Fate, Or aught by me immutablie foreseen, They trespass, Authors to themselves in all Both what they judge and what they choose; for so I formd them free, and free they must remain, Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change Thir nature, and revoke the high Decree Unchangeable, Eternal, which ordain\u2019d Thir freedom, they themselves ordain\u2019d thir fall. The first sort by thir own suggestion fell, Self-tempted, self-deprav\u2019d: Man falls deceiv\u2019d By the other first: Man therefore shall find", "grace, The other none: in Mercy and Justice both, Through Heav\u2019n and Earth, so shall my glorie excel, But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine. Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill\u2019d All Heav\u2019n, and in the blessed Spirits elect Sense of new joy ineffable diffus\u2019d: Beyond compare the Son of God was seen Most glorious, in him all his Father shon Substantially express\u2019d, and in his face Divine compassion visibly appeerd, Love without end, and without measure Grace, Which uttering thus he to his Father spake. O Father, gracious was that word which clos\u2019d Thy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace; For which both Heav\u2019n and Earth shall high extoll Thy praises, with th\u2019 innumerable sound Of Hymns and sacred Songs, wherewith thy Throne Encompass\u2019d shall resound thee ever blest. For should Man finally be lost, should Man Thy creature late so lov\u2019d, thy youngest Son Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joynd With his own folly? that be from thee farr, That farr be from thee, Father, who art Judge Of all things made, and judgest onely right. Or shall the Adversarie thus obtain His end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfill His malice, and thy goodness bring to naught, Or proud return though to his heavier doom, Yet with revenge accomplish\u2019t and to Hell Draw after him the whole Race of mankind, By him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self Abolish thy Creation, and unmake, For him, what for thy glorie thou hast made? So should thy goodness and thy greatness both Be questiond and blaspheam\u2019d without defence. To whom the great Creatour thus reply\u2019d. O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight, Son of my bosom, Son who art alone My word, my wisdom, and effectual might, All hast thou spok\u2019n as my thoughts are, all As my Eternal purpose hath decreed: Man shall not quite be lost, but sav\u2019d who will, Yet not of will in him, but grace in me Freely voutsaft; once more I will renew His lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthrall\u2019d By sin to foul exorbitant desires; Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand On even ground against his mortal foe, By me upheld, that he may know how frail His fall\u2019n condition is, and to me ow All his deliv\u2019rance, and to none but me. Some I have chosen of peculiar grace Elect above the rest; so is my will: The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes Th\u2019 incensed Deitie, while offerd grace Invites; for I will cleer thir senses dark, What may suffice, and soft\u2019n stonie hearts To pray, repent, and bring obedience due. To prayer, repentance, and obedience due, Though but endevord with sincere intent, Mine eare shall not be slow, mine eye not shut. And I will place within them as a guide My Umpire Conscience, whom if they will hear, Light after light well us\u2019d they shall attain, And to the", "end persisting, safe arrive. This my long sufferance and my day of grace They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste; But hard be hard\u2019nd, blind be blinded more, That they may stumble on, and deeper fall; And none but such from mercy I exclude. But yet all is not don; Man disobeying, Disloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinns Against the high Supremacie of Heav\u2019n, Affecting God-head, and so loosing all, To expiate his Treason hath naught left, But to destruction sacred and devote, He with his whole posteritie must die, Die hee or Justice must; unless for him Som other able, and as willing, pay The rigid satisfaction, death for death. Say Heav\u2019nly Powers, where shall we find such love, Which of ye will be mortal to redeem Mans mortal crime, and just th\u2019 unjust to save, Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare? He ask\u2019d, but all the Heav\u2019nly Quire stood mute, And silence was in Heav\u2019n: on mans behalf Patron or Intercessor none appeerd, Much less that durst upon his own head draw The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set. And now without redemption all mankind Must have bin lost, adjudg\u2019d to Death and Hell By doom severe, had not the Son of God, In whom the fulness dwels of love divine, His dearest mediation thus renewd. Father, thy word is past, man shall find grace; And shall grace not find means, that finds her way, The speediest of thy winged messengers, To visit all thy creatures, and to all Comes unprevented, unimplor\u2019d, unsought, Happie for man, so coming; he her aide Can never seek, once dead in sins and lost; Attonement for himself or offering meet, Indebted and undon, hath none to bring: Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life I offer, on mee let thine anger fall; Account mee man; I for his sake will leave Thy bosom, and this glorie next to thee Freely put off, and for him lastly die Well pleas\u2019d, on me let Death wreck all his rage; Under his gloomie power I shall not long Lie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to possess Life in my self for ever, by thee I live, Though now to Death I yeild, and am his due All that of me can die, yet that debt paid, Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave His prey, nor suffer my unspotted Soule For ever with corruption there to dwell; But I shall rise Victorious, and subdue My Vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile; Death his deaths wound shall then receive, & stoop Inglorious, of his mortall sting disarm\u2019d. I through the ample Air in Triumph high Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and show The powers of darkness bound. Thou at the sight Pleas\u2019d, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile, While by thee rais\u2019d I ruin all my Foes, Death last, and with his Carcass glut the Grave: Then with the multitude of my redeemd Shall enter Heaven long absent,", "and returne, Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud Of anger shall remain, but peace assur\u2019d, And reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more Thenceforth, but in thy presence Joy entire. His words here ended, but his meek aspect Silent yet spake, and breath\u2019d immortal love To mortal men, above which only shon Filial obedience: as a sacrifice Glad to be offer\u2019d, he attends the will Of his great Father. Admiration seis\u2019d All Heav\u2019n, what this might mean, & whither tend Wondring; but soon th\u2019 Almighty thus reply\u2019d: O thou in Heav\u2019n and Earth the only peace Found out for mankind under wrauth, O thou My sole complacence! well thou know\u2019st how dear, To me are all my works, nor Man the least Though last created, that for him I spare Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save, By loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost. Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeeme, Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyne; And be thy self Man among men on Earth, Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed, By wondrous birth: Be thou in Adams room The Head of all mankind, though Adams Son. As in him perish all men, so in thee As from a second root shall be restor\u2019d, As many as are restor\u2019d, without thee none. His crime makes guiltie all his Sons, thy merit Imputed shall absolve them who renounce Thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds, And live in thee transplanted, and from thee Receive new life. So Man, as is most just, Shall satisfie for Man, be judg\u2019d and die, And dying rise, and rising with him raise His Brethren, ransomd with his own dear life. So Heav\u2019nly love shal outdoo Hellish hate, Giving to death, and dying to redeeme, So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate So easily destroy\u2019d, and still destroyes In those who, when they may, accept not grace. Nor shalt thou by descending to assume Mans Nature, less\u2019n or degrade thine owne. Because thou hast, though Thron\u2019d in highest bliss Equal to God, and equally enjoying God-like fruition, quitted all to save A World from utter loss, and hast been found By Merit more then Birthright Son of God, Found worthiest to be so by being Good, Farr more then Great or High; because in thee Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds, Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne; Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reigne Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man, Anointed universal King; all Power I give thee, reign for ever, and assume Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce: All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell; When thou attended gloriously from Heav\u2019n Shalt in the Skie appeer, and from thee send The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Windes The", "living, and forthwith the cited dead Of all past Ages to the general Doom Shall hast\u2019n, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep. Then all thy Saints assembl\u2019d, thou shalt judge Bad men and Angels, they arraignd shall sink Beneath thy Sentence; Hell, her numbers full, Thenceforth shall be for ever shut. Mean while The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring New Heav\u2019n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell And after all thir tribulations long See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds, With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth. Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by, For regal Scepter then no more shall need, God shall be All in All. But all ye Gods, Adore him, who to compass all this dies, Adore the Son, and honour him as mee. No sooner had th\u2019 Almighty ceas\u2019t, but all The multitude of Angels with a shout Loud as from numbers without number, sweet As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav\u2019n rung With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna\u2019s fill\u2019d Th\u2019 eternal Regions: lowly reverent Towards either Throne they bow, & to the ground With solemn adoration down they cast Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold, Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence To Heav\u2019n remov\u2019d where first it grew, there grows, And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life, And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heavn Rowls o\u2019re Elisian Flours her Amber stream; With these that never fade the Spirits Elect Bind thir resplendent locks inwreath\u2019d with beams, Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shon Impurpl\u2019d with Celestial Roses smil\u2019d. Then Crown\u2019d again thir gold\u2019n Harps they took, Harps ever tun\u2019d, that glittering by their side Like Quivers hung, and with Praeamble sweet Of charming symphonie they introduce Thir sacred Song, and waken raptures high; No voice exempt, no voice but well could joine Melodious part, such concord is in Heav\u2019n. Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent, Immutable, Immortal, Infinite, Eternal King; thee Author of all being, Fountain of Light, thy self invisible Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit\u2019st Thron\u2019d inaccessible, but when thou shad\u2019st The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine, Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer, Yet dazle Heav\u2019n, that brightest Seraphim Approach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes. Thee next they sang of all Creation first, Begotten Son, Divine Similitude, In whose conspicuous count\u2019nance, without cloud Made visible, th\u2019 Almighty Father shines, Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides, Transfus\u2019d on thee his ample Spirit rests. Hee Heav\u2019n of Heavens and all the Powers therein By thee created, and by thee threw down Th\u2019 aspiring Dominations: thou that day Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare, Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that", "shook Heav\u2019ns everlasting Frame, while o\u2019re the necks Thou drov\u2019st of warring Angels disarraid. Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime Thee only extold, Son of thy Fathers might, To execute fierce vengeance on his foes, Not so on Man; him through their malice fall\u2019n, Father of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not doome So strictly, but much more to pitie encline: No sooner did thy dear and onely Son Perceive thee purpos\u2019d not to doom frail Man So strictly, but much more to pitie enclin\u2019d, He to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife Of Mercy and Justice in thy face discern\u2019d, Regardless of the Bliss wherein hee sat Second to thee, offerd himself to die For mans offence. O unexampl\u2019d love, Love no where to be found less then Divine! Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name Shall be the copious matter of my Song Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoine. Thus they in Heav\u2019n, above the starry Sphear, Thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent. Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe Of this round World, whose first convex divides The luminous inferior Orbs, enclos\u2019d From Chaos and th\u2019 inroad of Darkness old, Satan alighted walks: a Globe farr off It seem\u2019d, now seems a boundless Continent Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night Starless expos\u2019d, and ever-threatning storms Of Chaos blustring round, inclement skie; Save on that side which from the wall of Heav\u2019n Though distant farr som small reflection gaines Of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud: Here walk\u2019d the Fiend at large in spacious field. As when a Vultur on Imaus bred, Whose snowie ridge the roving Tartar bounds, Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams; But in his way lights on the barren plaines Of Sericana, where Chineses drive With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light: So on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend Walk\u2019d up and down alone bent on his prey, Alone, for other Creature in this place Living or liveless to be found was none, None yet, but store hereafter from the earth Up hither like Aereal vapours flew Of all things transitorie and vain, when Sin With vanity had filld the works of men: Both all things vain, and all who in vain things Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame, Or happiness in this or th\u2019 other life; All who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal, Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find Fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds; All th\u2019 unaccomplisht works of Natures hand, Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt, Dissolvd on earth, fleet hither, and in vain, Till final dissolution, wander here, Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd; Those", "argent Fields more likely habitants, Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold Betwixt th\u2019 Angelical and Human kinde: Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born First from the ancient World those Giants came With many a vain exploit, though then renownd: The builders next of Babel on the Plain Of Sennaar, and still with vain designe New Babels, had they wherewithall, would build: Others came single; hee who to be deemd A God, leap\u2019d fondly into Aetna flames, Empedocles, and hee who to enjoy Plato\u2019s Elysium, leap\u2019d into the Sea, Cleombrotus, and many more too long, Embryo\u2019s and Idiots, Eremits and Friers White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie. Here Pilgrims roam, that stray\u2019d so farr to seek In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heav\u2019n; And they who to be sure of Paradise Dying put on the weeds of Dominic, Or in Franciscan think to pass disguis\u2019d; They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt, And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs The Trepidation talkt, and that first mov\u2019d; And now Saint Peter at Heav\u2019ns Wicket seems To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot Of Heav\u2019ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe A violent cross wind from either Coast Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry Into the devious Air; then might ye see Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads, Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls, The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft Fly o\u2019re the backside of the World farr off Into a Limbo large and broad, since calld The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown Long after, now unpeopl\u2019d, and untrod; All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he pass\u2019d, And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste His travell\u2019d steps; farr distant hee descries Ascending by degrees magnificent Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high, At top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn. The Stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw Angels ascending and descending, bands Of Guardians bright, when he from Esau fled To Padan-Aram in the field of Luz, Dreaming by night under the open Skie, And waking cri\u2019d, This is the Gate of Heav\u2019n. Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood There alwaies, but drawn up to Heav\u2019n somtimes Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flow\u2019d Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, whereon Who after came from Earth, sayling arriv\u2019d, Wafted by Angels, or flew o\u2019re the Lake Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds. The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare The Fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate His sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss. Direct against which op\u2019nd from beneath, Just o\u2019re the blissful seat of Paradise, A passage down", "to th\u2019 Earth, a passage wide, Wider by farr then that of after-times Over Mount Sion, and, though that were large, Over the Promis\u2019d Land to God so dear, By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes, On high behests his Angels to and fro Pass\u2019d frequent, and his eye with choice regard From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood To Beersaba, where the Holy Land Borders on Aegypt and the Arabian shoare; So wide the op\u2019ning seemd, where bounds were set To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave. Satan from hence now on the lower stair That scal\u2019d by steps of Gold to Heav\u2019n Gate Looks down with wonder at the sudden view Of all this World at once. As when a Scout Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone All night; at last by break of chearful dawne Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill, Which to his eye discovers unaware The goodly prospect of some forein land First-seen, or some renownd Metropolis With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd, Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams. Such wonder seis\u2019d, though after Heaven seen, The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis\u2019d At sight of all this World beheld so faire. Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood So high above the circling Canopie Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point Of Libra to the fleecie Starr that bears Andromeda farr off Atlantick Seas Beyond th\u2019 Horizon; then from Pole to Pole He views in bredth, and without longer pause Down right into the Worlds first Region throws His flight precipitant, and windes with ease Through the pure marble Air his oblique way Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds, Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles, Like those Hesperian Gardens fam\u2019d of old, Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales, Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there He stayd not to enquire: above them all The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven Allur\u2019d his eye: Thither his course he bends Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe By center, or eccentric, hard to tell, Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick, That from his Lordly eye keep distance due, Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute Days, months, and years, towards his all-chearing Lamp Turn swift their various motions, or are turnd By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms The Univers, and to each inward part With gentle penetration, though unseen, Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep: So wondrously was set his Station bright. There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps Astronomer in the Sun\u2019s lucent Orbe Through his glaz\u2019d Optic Tube yet never saw. The place he found beyond expression bright, Compar\u2019d with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone; Not all parts like, but all alike informd With radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire; If mettal,", "part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer; If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite, Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon In Aarons Brest-plate, and a stone besides Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen, That stone, or like to that which here below Philosophers in vain so long have sought, In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde Volatil Hermes, and call up unbound In various shapes old Proteus from the Sea, Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme. What wonder then if fields and regions here Breathe forth Elixir pure, and Rivers run Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch Th\u2019 Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt Here in the dark so many precious things Of colour glorious and effect so rare? Here matter new to gaze the Devil met Undazl\u2019d, farr and wide his eye commands, For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon Culminate from th\u2019 Aequator, as they now Shot upward still direct, whence no way round Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire, No where so cleer, sharp\u2019nd his visual ray To objects distant farr, whereby he soon Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand, The same whom John saw also in the Sun: His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid; Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar Circl\u2019d his Head, nor less his Locks behind Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy\u2019d Hee seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep. Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope To find who might direct his wandring flight To Paradise the happie seat of Man, His journies end and our beginning woe. But first he casts to change his proper shape, Which else might work him danger or delay: And now a stripling Cherube he appeers, Not of the prime, yet such as in his face Youth smil\u2019d Celestial, and to every Limb Sutable grace diffus\u2019d, so well he feignd; Under a Coronet his flowing haire In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore Of many a colourd plume sprinkl\u2019d with Gold, His habit fit for speed succinct, and held Before his decent steps a Silver wand. He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright, Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd, Admonisht by his eare, and strait was known Th\u2019 Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seav\u2019n Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes That run through all the Heav\u2019ns, or down to th\u2019 Earth Bear his swift errands over moist and dry, O\u2019re Sea and Land: him Satan thus accostes; Uriel, for thou of those seav\u2019n Spirits that stand In sight of God\u2019s high Throne, gloriously bright, The first art wont his great authentic will Interpreter through highest Heav\u2019n to bring, Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend; And here art likeliest by supream decree Like", "honour to obtain, and as his Eye To visit oft this new Creation round; Unspeakable desire to see, and know All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man, His chief delight and favour, him for whom All these his works so wondrous he ordaind, Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim Alone thus wandring. Brightest Seraph tell In which of all these shining Orbes hath Man His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none, But all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell; That I may find him, and with secret gaze, Or open admiration him behold On whom the great Creator hath bestowd Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd; That both in him and all things, as is meet, The Universal Maker we may praise; Who justly hath drivn out his Rebell Foes To deepest Hell, and to repair that loss Created this new happie Race of Men To serve him better: wise are all his wayes. So spake the false dissembler unperceivd; For neither Man nor Angel can discern Hypocrisie, the only evil that walks Invisible, except to God alone, By his permissive will, through Heav\u2019n and Earth: And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil\u2019d Uriel, though Regent of the Sun, and held The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav\u2019n; Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule In his uprightness answer thus returnd. Faire Angel, thy desire which tends to know The works of God, thereby to glorifie The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess That reaches blame, but rather merits praise The more it seems excess, that led thee hither From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone, To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps Contented with report heare onely in heav\u2019n: For wonderful indeed are all his works, Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all Had in remembrance alwayes with delight; But what created mind can comprehend Thir number, or the wisdom infinite That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep. I saw when at his Word the formless Mass, This worlds material mould, came to a heap: Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar Stood rul\u2019d, stood vast infinitude confin\u2019d; Till at his second bidding darkness fled, Light shon, and order from disorder sprung: Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire, And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav\u2019n Flew upward, spirited with various forms, That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move; Each had his place appointed, each his course, The rest in circuit walles this Universe. Look downward on that Globe whose hither side With light from hence, though but reflected, shines; That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light His day, which else as th\u2019 other Hemisphere Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon (So call that opposite fair", "Starr) her aide Timely interposes, and her monthly round Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav\u2019n; With borrowd light her countenance triform Hence fills and empties to enlighten th\u2019 Earth, And in her pale dominion checks the night. That spot to which I point is Paradise, Adams abode, those loftie shades his Bowre. Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires. Thus said, he turnd, and Satan bowing low, As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven, Where honour due and reverence none neglects, Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath, Down from th\u2019 Ecliptic, sped with hop\u2019d success, Throws his steep flight with many an Aerie wheele, Nor staid, till on Niphates top he lights. THE END OF THE THIRD BOOK. PARADISE LOST BOOK IV. O For that warning voice, which he who saw Th\u2019 Apocalyps, heard cry in Heaven aloud, Then when the Dragon, put to second rout, Came furious down to be reveng\u2019d on men, Wo to the Inhabitants on Earth! that now, While time was, our first Parents had bin warnd The coming of thir secret foe, and scap\u2019d Haply so scap\u2019d his mortal snare; for now Satan, now first inflam\u2019d with rage, came down, The Tempter ere th\u2019 Accuser of man-kind, To wreck on innocent frail man his loss Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell: Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold, Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast, Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest, And like a devillish Engine back recoiles Upon himself; horror and doubt distract His troubl\u2019d thoughts, and from the bottom stirr The Hell within him, for within him Hell He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell One step no more then from himself can fly By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie Of what he was, what is, and what must be Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue. Sometimes towards Eden which now in his view Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad, Sometimes towards Heav\u2019n and the full-blazing Sun, Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre: Then much revolving, thus in sighs began. O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd, Look\u2019st from thy sole Dominion like the God Of this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs Hide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call, But with no friendly voice, and add thy name O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams That bring to my remembrance from what state I fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare; Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down Warring in Heav\u2019n against Heav\u2019ns matchless King: Ah wherefore! he deservd no such return From me, whom he created what I was In that bright eminence, and with his good Upbraided none; nor was his service hard. What could be less then to afford him praise, The easiest recompence,", "and pay him thanks, How due! yet all his good prov\u2019d ill in me, And wrought but malice; lifted up so high I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher Would set me highest, and in a moment quit The debt immense of endless gratitude, So burthensome, still paying, still to ow; Forgetful what from him I still receivd, And understood not that a grateful mind By owing owes not, but still pays, at once Indebted and dischargd; what burden then? O had his powerful Destiny ordaind Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood Then happie; no unbounded hope had rais\u2019d Ambition. Yet why not? som other Power As great might have aspir\u2019d, and me though mean Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great Fell not, but stand unshak\u2019n, from within Or from without, to all temptations arm\u2019d. Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand? Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse, But Heav\u2019ns free Love dealt equally to all? Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate, To me alike, it deals eternal woe. Nay curs\u2019d be thou; since against his thy will Chose freely what it now so justly rues. Me miserable! which way shall I flie Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire? Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell; And in the lowest deep a lower deep Still threatning to devour me opens wide, To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav\u2019n. O then at last relent: is there no place Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left? None left but by submission; and that word Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc\u2019d With other promises and other vaunts Then to submit, boasting I could subdue Th\u2019 Omnipotent. Ay me, they little know How dearly I abide that boast so vaine, Under what torments inwardly I groane; While they adore me on the Throne of Hell, With Diadem and Scepter high advanc\u2019d The lower still I fall, onely Supream In miserie; such joy Ambition findes. But say I could repent and could obtaine By Act of Grace my former state; how soon Would highth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay What feign\u2019d submission swore: ease would recant Vows made in pain, as violent and void. For never can true reconcilement grow Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc\u2019d so deep: Which would but lead me to a worse relapse And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare Short intermission bought with double smart. This knows my punisher; therefore as farr From granting hee, as I from begging peace: All hope excluded thus, behold in stead Of us out-cast, exil\u2019d, his new delight, Mankind created, and for him this World. So farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear, Farwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost; Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least Divided Empire with Heav\u2019ns King I hold By thee, and more then half", "perhaps will reigne; As Man ere long, and this new World shall know. Thus while he spake, each passion dimm\u2019d his face Thrice chang\u2019d with pale, ire, envie and despair, Which marrd his borrow\u2019d visage, and betraid Him counterfet, if any eye beheld. For heav\u2019nly mindes from such distempers foule Are ever cleer. Whereof hee soon aware, Each perturbation smooth\u2019d with outward calme, Artificer of fraud; and was the first That practisd falshood under saintly shew, Deep malice to conceale, couch\u2019t with revenge: Yet not anough had practisd to deceive Uriel once warnd; whose eye pursu\u2019d him down The way he went, and on th\u2019 Assyrian mount Saw him disfigur\u2019d, more then could befall Spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce He markd and mad demeanour, then alone, As he suppos\u2019d, all unobserv\u2019d, unseen. So on he fares, and to the border comes Of Eden, where delicious Paradise, Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green, As with a rural mound the champain head Of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides With thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde, Access deni\u2019d; and over head up grew Insuperable highth of loftiest shade, Cedar, and Pine, and Firr, and branching Palm, A Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend Shade above shade, a woodie Theatre Of stateliest view. Yet higher then thir tops The verdurous wall of Paradise up sprung: Which to our general Sire gave prospect large Into his neather Empire neighbouring round. And higher then that Wall a circling row Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit, Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt: On which the Sun more glad impress\u2019d his beams Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow, When God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd That Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires Vernal delight and joy, able to drive All sadness but despair: now gentle gales Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole Those balmie spoiles. As when to them who saile Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past Mozambic, off at Sea North-East windes blow Sabean Odours from the spicie shoare Of Arabie the blest, with such delay Well pleas\u2019d they slack thir course, and many a League Cheard with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles. So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend Who came thir bane, though with them better pleas\u2019d Then Asmodeus with the fishie fume, That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse Of Tobits Son, and with a vengeance sent From Media post to Aegypt, there fast bound. Now to th\u2019 ascent of that steep savage Hill Satan had journied on, pensive and slow; But further way found none, so thick entwin\u2019d, As one continu\u2019d brake, the undergrowth Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext All path of Man or Beast that past that way: One Gate there onely was, and that look\u2019d East On th\u2019 other side: which when", "th\u2019 arch-fellon saw Due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt, At one slight bound high overleap\u2019d all bound Of Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within Lights on his feet. As when a prowling Wolfe, Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve In hurdl\u2019d Cotes amid the field secure, Leaps o\u2019re the fence with ease into the Fould: Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores, Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault, In at the window climbes, or o\u2019re the tiles; So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould: So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe. Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life, The middle Tree and highest there that grew, Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life Thereby regaind, but sat devising Death To them who liv\u2019d; nor on the vertue thought Of that life-giving Plant, but only us\u2019d For prospect, what well us\u2019d had bin the pledge Of immortalitie. So little knows Any, but God alone, to value right The good before him, but perverts best things To worst abuse, or to thir meanest use. Beneath him with new wonder now he views To all delight of human sense expos\u2019d In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more, A Heaven on Earth, for blissful Paradise Of God the Garden was, by him in the East Of Eden planted; Eden stretchd her Line From Auran Eastward to the Royal Towrs Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian Kings, Or where the Sons of Eden long before Dwelt in Telassar: in this pleasant soile His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind; Out of the fertil ground he caus\u2019d to grow All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; And all amid them stood the Tree of Life, High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life Our Death the Tree of Knowledge grew fast by, Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill. Southward through Eden went a River large, Nor chang\u2019d his course, but through the shaggie hill Pass\u2019d underneath ingulft, for God had thrown That Mountain as his Garden mould high rais\u2019d Upon the rapid current, which through veins Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn, Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill Waterd the Garden; thence united fell Down the steep glade, and met the neather Flood, Which from his darksom passage now appeers, And now divided into four main Streams, Runs divers, wandring many a famous Realme And Country whereof here needs no account, But rather to tell how, if Art could tell, How from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks, Rowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold, With mazie error under pendant shades Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale", "and Plaine, Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote The open field, and where the unpierc\u2019t shade Imbround the noontide Bowrs: Thus was this place, A happy rural seat of various view; Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme, Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde Hung amiable, Hesperian Fables true, If true, here onely, and of delicious taste: Betwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks Grasing the tender herb, were interpos\u2019d, Or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap Of som irriguous Valley spread her store, Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose: Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves Of coole recess, o\u2019re which the mantling Vine Layes forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall Down the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake, That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd, Her chrystall mirror holds, unite thir streams. The Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires, Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune The trembling leaves, while Universal Pan Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance Led on th\u2019 Eternal Spring. Not that faire field Of Enna, where Proserpin gathring flours Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie Dis Was gatherd, which cost Ceres all that pain To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove Of Daphne by Orontes, and th\u2019 inspir\u2019d Castalian Spring might with this Paradise Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian Ile Girt with the River Triton, where old Cham, Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove, Hid Amalthea and her Florid Son Young Bacchus from his Stepdame Rhea\u2019s eye; Nor where Abassin Kings thir issue Guard, Mount Amara, though this by som suppos\u2019d True Paradise under the Ethiop Line By Nilus head, enclos\u2019d with shining Rock, A whole dayes journey high, but wide remote From this Assyrian Garden, where the Fiend Saw undelighted all delight, all kind Of living Creatures new to sight and strange: Two of far nobler shape erect and tall, Godlike erect, with native Honour clad In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all, And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine The image of thir glorious Maker shon, Truth, Wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure, Severe, but in true filial freedom plac\u2019t; Whence true autoritie in men; though both Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd; For contemplation hee and valour formd, For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace, Hee for God only, shee for God in him: His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar\u2019d Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks Round from his parted forelock manly hung Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad: Shee as a vail down to the slender waste Her unadorned golden tresses wore Dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav\u2019d As the Vine curles her tendrils, which impli\u2019d Subjection, but requir\u2019d with gentle sway, And by her yeilded, by him best receivd, Yeilded with coy submission, modest pride, And sweet reluctant amorous delay. Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald,", "Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame Of natures works, honor dishonorable, Sin-bred, how have ye troubl\u2019d all mankind With shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure, And banisht from mans life his happiest life, Simplicitie and spotless innocence. So passd they naked on, nor shund the sight Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill: So hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair That ever since in loves imbraces met, Adam the goodliest man of men since borne His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters Eve. Under a tuft of shade that on a green Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side They sat them down, and after no more toil Of thir sweet Gardning labour then suffic\u2019d To recommend coole Zephyr, and made ease More easie, wholsom thirst and appetite More grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell, Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes Yeilded them, side-long as they sat recline On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours: The savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream; Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League, Alone as they. About them frisking playd All Beasts of th\u2019 Earth, since wilde, and of all chase In Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den; Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw Dandl\u2019d the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards Gambold before them, th\u2019 unwieldy Elephant To make them mirth us\u2019d all his might, & wreathd His Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine His breaded train, and of his fatal guile Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass Coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat, Or Bedward ruminating: for the Sun Declin\u2019d was hasting now with prone carreer To th\u2019 Ocean Iles, and in th\u2019 ascending Scale Of Heav\u2019n the Starrs that usher Evening rose: When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood, Scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad. O Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold, Into our room of bliss thus high advanc\u2019t Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps, Not Spirits, yet to heav\u2019nly Spirits bright Little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue With wonder, and could love, so lively shines In them Divine resemblance, and such grace The hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd. Ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh Your change approaches, when all these delights Will vanish and deliver ye to woe, More woe, the more your taste is now of joy; Happie, but for so happie ill secur\u2019d Long to continue, and this high seat your Heav\u2019n Ill fenc\u2019t for Heav\u2019n to keep out such a foe As now is enterd; yet no purpos\u2019d foe To you whom I could pittie thus forlorne Though I unpittied: League with you I seek, And mutual amitie so streight, so close, That I with you must dwell, or you with me Henceforth; my", "dwelling haply may not please Like this fair Paradise, your sense, yet such Accept your Makers work; he gave it me, Which I as freely give; Hell shall unfould, To entertain you two, her widest Gates, And send forth all her Kings; there will be room, Not like these narrow limits, to receive Your numerous ofspring; if no better place, Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge On you who wrong me not for him who wrongd. And should I at your harmless innocence Melt, as I doe, yet public reason just, Honour and Empire with revenge enlarg\u2019d, By conquering this new World, compels me now To do what else though damnd I should abhorre. So spake the Fiend, and with necessitie, The Tyrants plea, excus\u2019d his devilish deeds. Then from his loftie stand on that high Tree Down he alights among the sportful Herd Of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one, Now other, as thir shape servd best his end Neerer to view his prey, and unespi\u2019d To mark what of thir state he more might learn By word or action markt: about them round A Lion now he stalkes with fierie glare, Then as a Tiger, who by chance hath spi\u2019d In some Purlieu two gentle Fawnes at play, Strait couches close, then rising changes oft His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground Whence rushing he might surest seise them both Grip\u2019t in each paw: when Adam first of men To first of women Eve thus moving speech, Turnd him all eare to heare new utterance flow. Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes, Dearer thy self then all; needs must the Power That made us, and for us this ample World Be infinitly good, and of his good As liberal and free as infinite, That rais\u2019d us from the dust and plac\u2019t us here In all this happiness, who at his hand Have nothing merited, nor can performe Aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires From us no other service then to keep This one, this easie charge, of all the Trees In Paradise that beare delicious fruit So various, not to taste that onely Tree Of knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life, So neer grows Death to Life, what ere Death is, Som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst God hath pronounc\u2019t it death to taste that Tree, The only sign of our obedience left Among so many signes of power and rule Conferrd upon us, and Dominion giv\u2019n Over all other Creatures that possesse Earth, Aire, and Sea. Then let us not think hard One easie prohibition, who enjoy Free leave so large to all things else, and choice Unlimited of manifold delights: But let us ever praise him, and extoll His bountie, following our delightful task To prune these growing Plants, & tend these Flours, Which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet. To whom thus Eve repli\u2019d. O thou for whom And", "from whom I was formd flesh of thy flesh, And without whom am to no end, my Guide And Head, what thou hast said is just and right. For wee to him indeed all praises owe, And daily thanks, I chiefly who enjoy So farr the happier Lot, enjoying thee Preeminent by so much odds, while thou Like consort to thy self canst no where find. That day I oft remember, when from sleep I first awak\u2019t, and found my self repos\u2019d Under a shade on flours, much wondring where And what I was, whence thither brought, and how. Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound Of waters issu\u2019d from a Cave and spread Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmov\u2019d Pure as th\u2019 expanse of Heav\u2019n; I thither went With unexperienc\u2019t thought, and laid me downe On the green bank, to look into the cleer Smooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie. As I bent down to look, just opposite, A Shape within the watry gleam appeerd Bending to look on me, I started back, It started back, but pleasd I soon returnd, Pleas\u2019d it returnd as soon with answering looks Of sympathie and love, there I had fixt Mine eyes till now, and pin\u2019d with vain desire, Had not a voice thus warnd me, What thou seest, What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self, With thee it came and goes: but follow me, And I will bring thee where no shadow staies Thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee Whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy Inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare Multitudes like thy self, and thence be call\u2019d Mother of human Race: what could I doe, But follow strait, invisibly thus led? Till I espi\u2019d thee, fair indeed and tall, Under a Platan, yet methought less faire, Less winning soft, less amiablie milde, Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd, Thou following cryd\u2019st aloud, Return fair Eve, Whom fli\u2019st thou? whom thou fli\u2019st, of him thou art, His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart Substantial Life, to have thee by my side Henceforth an individual solace dear; Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim My other half: with that thy gentle hand Seisd mine, I yeilded, and from that time see How beauty is excelld by manly grace And wisdom, which alone is truly fair. So spake our general Mother, and with eyes Of conjugal attraction unreprov\u2019d, And meek surrender, half imbracing leand On our first Father, half her swelling Breast Naked met his under the flowing Gold Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms Smil\u2019d with superior Love, as Jupiter On Juno smiles, when he impregns the Clouds That shed May Flowers; and press\u2019d her Matron lip With kisses pure: aside the Devil turnd For envie, yet with jealous leer maligne Ey\u2019d them askance, and to", "himself thus plaind. Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two Imparadis\u2019t in one anothers arms The happier Eden, shall enjoy thir fill Of bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust, Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire, Among our other torments not the least, Still unfulfill\u2019d with pain of longing pines; Yet let me not forget what I have gain\u2019d From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems: One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call\u2019d, Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidd\u2019n? Suspicious, reasonless. Why should thir Lord Envie them that? can it be sin to know, Can it be death? and do they onely stand By Ignorance, is that thir happie state, The proof of thir obedience and thir faith? O fair foundation laid whereon to build Thir ruine! Hence I will excite thir minds With more desire to know, and to reject Envious commands, invented with designe To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt Equal with Gods; aspiring to be such, They taste and die: what likelier can ensue? But first with narrow search I must walk round This Garden, and no corner leave unspi\u2019d; A chance but chance may lead where I may meet Some wandring Spirit of Heav\u2019n, by Fountain side, Or in thick shade retir\u2019d, from him to draw What further would be learnt. Live while ye may, Yet happie pair; enjoy, till I return, Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed. So saying, his proud step he scornful turn\u2019d, But with sly circumspection, and began Through wood, through waste, o\u2019re hil, o\u2019re dale his roam. Mean while in utmost Longitude, where Heav\u2019n With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun Slowly descended, and with right aspect Against the eastern Gate of Paradise Leveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock Of Alablaster, pil\u2019d up to the Clouds, Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent Accessible from Earth, one entrance high; The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung Still as it rose, impossible to climbe. Betwixt these rockie Pillars Gabriel sat Chief of th\u2019 Angelic Guards, awaiting night; About him exercis\u2019d Heroic Games Th\u2019 unarmed Youth of Heav\u2019n, but nigh at hand Celestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold. Thither came Uriel, gliding through the Eeven On a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Starr In Autumn thwarts the night, when vapors fir\u2019d Impress the Air, and shews the Mariner From what point of his Compass to beware Impetuous winds: he thus began in haste. Gabriel, to thee thy cours by Lot hath giv\u2019n Charge and strict watch that to this happie place No evil thing approach or enter in; This day at highth of Noon came to my Spheare A Spirit, zealous, as he seem\u2019d, to know More of th\u2019 Almighties works, and chiefly Man Gods latest Image: I describ\u2019d his way Bent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate; But in the Mount that lies from Eden North, Where", "he first lighted, soon discernd his looks Alien from Heav\u2019n, with passions foul obscur\u2019d: Mine eye pursu\u2019d him still, but under shade Lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew I fear, hath ventur\u2019d from the deep, to raise New troubles; him thy care must be to find. To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd: Uriel, no wonder if thy perfet sight, Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst, See farr and wide: in at this Gate none pass The vigilance here plac\u2019t, but such as come Well known from Heav\u2019n; and since Meridian hour No Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort, So minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds On purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude Spiritual substance with corporeal barr. But if within the circuit of these walks In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom Thou telst, by morrow dawning I shall know. So promis\u2019d hee, and Uriel to his charge Returnd on that bright beam, whose point now raisd Bore him slope downward to the Sun now fall\u2019n Beneath th\u2019 Azores; whither the prime Orb, Incredible how swift, had thither rowl\u2019d Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth By shorter flight to th\u2019 East, had left him there Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend: Now came still Eevning on, and Twilight gray Had in her sober Liverie all things clad; Silence accompanied, for Beast and Bird, They to thir grassie Couch, these to thir Nests Were slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale; She all night long her amorous descant sung; Silence was pleas\u2019d: now glow\u2019d the Firmament With living Saphirs: Hesperus that led The starrie Host, rode brightest, till the Moon Rising in clouded Majestie, at length Apparent Queen unvaild her peerless light, And o\u2019re the dark her Silver Mantle threw. When Adam thus to Eve: Fair Consort, th\u2019 hour Of night, and all things now retir\u2019d to rest Mind us of like repose, since God hath set Labour and rest, as day and night to men Successive, and the timely dew of sleep Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines Our eye-lids; other Creatures all day long Rove idle unimploid, and less need rest; Man hath his daily work of body or mind Appointed, which declares his Dignitie, And the regard of Heav\u2019n on all his waies; While other Animals unactive range, And of thir doings God takes no account. Tomorrow ere fresh Morning streak the East With first approach of light, we must be ris\u2019n, And at our pleasant labour, to reform Yon flourie Arbors, yonder Allies green, Our walks at noon, with branches overgrown, That mock our scant manuring, and require More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth: Those Blossoms also, and those dropping Gumms, That lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth, Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease; Mean while, as Nature wills, Night bids us rest. To whom thus Eve with perfet beauty adornd. My Author and Disposer, what", "thou bidst Unargu\u2019d I obey; so God ordains, God is thy Law, thou mine: to know no more Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise. With thee conversing I forget all time, All seasons and thir change, all please alike. Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet, With charm of earliest Birds; pleasant the Sun When first on this delightful Land he spreads His orient Beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour, Glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth After soft showers; and sweet the coming on Of grateful Eevning milde, then silent Night With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon, And these the Gemms of Heav\u2019n, her starrie train: But neither breath of Morn when she ascends With charm of earliest Birds, nor rising Sun On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure, Glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers, Nor grateful Evening mild, nor silent Night With this her solemn Bird, nor walk by Moon, Or glittering Starr-light without thee is sweet. But wherfore all night long shine these, for whom This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes? To whom our general Ancestor repli\u2019d. Daughter of God and Man, accomplisht Eve, Those have thir course to finish, round the Earth, By morrow Eevning, and from Land to Land In order, though to Nations yet unborn, Ministring light prepar\u2019d, they set and rise; Least total darkness should by Night regaine Her old possession, and extinguish life In Nature and all things, which these soft fires Not only enlighten, but with kindly heate Of various influence foment and warme, Temper or nourish, or in part shed down Thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow On Earth, made hereby apter to receive Perfection from the Suns more potent Ray. These then, though unbeheld in deep of night, Shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none, That heav\u2019n would want spectators, God want praise; Millions of spiritual Creatures walk the Earth Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep: All these with ceasless praise his works behold Both day and night: how often from the steep Of echoing Hill or Thicket have we heard Celestial voices to the midnight air, Sole, or responsive each to others note Singing thir great Creator: oft in bands While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk With Heav\u2019nly touch of instrumental sounds In full harmonic number joind, thir songs Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven. Thus talking hand in hand alone they pass\u2019d On to thir blissful Bower; it was a place Chos\u2019n by the sovran Planter, when he fram\u2019d All things to mans delightful use; the roofe Of thickest covert was inwoven shade Laurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side Acanthus, and each odorous bushie shrub Fenc\u2019d up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour, Iris all hues, Roses, and Gessamin Rear\u2019d high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought Mosaic; underfoot the Violet, Crocus, and", "Hyacinth with rich inlay Broiderd the ground, more colour\u2019d then with stone Of costliest Emblem: other Creature here Beast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none; Such was thir awe of man. In shadier Bower More sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd, Pan or Silvanus never slept, nor Nymph, Nor Faunus haunted. Here in close recess With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs Espoused Eve deckt first her Nuptial Bed, And heav\u2019nly Quires the Hymenaean sung, What day the genial Angel to our Sire Brought her in naked beauty more adorn\u2019d, More lovely then Pandora, whom the Gods Endowd with all thir gifts, and O too like In sad event, when to the unwiser Son Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnar\u2019d Mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng\u2019d On him who had stole Joves authentic fire. Thus at thir shadie Lodge arriv\u2019d, both stood, Both turnd, and under op\u2019n Skie ador\u2019d The God that made both Skie, Air, Earth & Heav\u2019n Which they beheld, the Moons resplendent Globe And starrie Pole: Thou also mad\u2019st the Night, Maker Omnipotent, and thou the Day, Which we in our appointed work imployd Have finisht happie in our mutual help And mutual love, the Crown of all our bliss Ordain\u2019d by thee, and this delicious place For us too large, where thy abundance wants Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground. But thou hast promis\u2019d from us two a Race To fill the Earth, who shall with us extoll Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake, And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep. This said unanimous, and other Rites Observing none, but adoration pure Which God likes best, into thir inmost bower Handed they went; and eas\u2019d the putting off These troublesom disguises which wee wear, Strait side by side were laid, nor turnd I weene Adam from his fair Spouse, nor Eve the Rites Mysterious of connubial Love refus\u2019d: Whatever Hypocrites austerely talk Of puritie and place and innocence, Defaming as impure what God declares Pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all. Our Maker bids increase, who bids abstain But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man? Haile wedded Love, mysterious Law, true source Of human ofspring, sole proprietie, In Paradise of all things common else. By thee adulterous lust was driv\u2019n from men Among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee Founded in Reason, Loyal, Just, and Pure, Relations dear, and all the Charities Of Father, Son, and Brother first were known. Farr be it, that I should write thee sin or blame, Or think thee unbefitting holiest place, Perpetual Fountain of Domestic sweets, Whose Bed is undefil\u2019d and chast pronounc\u2019t, Present, or past, as Saints and Patriarchs us\u2019d. Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings, Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard, Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal, Or Serenate, which", "the starv\u2019d Lover sings To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. These lulld by Nightingales imbraceing slept, And on thir naked limbs the flourie roof Showrd Roses, which the Morn repair\u2019d. Sleep on, Blest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek No happier state, and know to know no more. Now had night measur\u2019d with her shaddowie Cone Half way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault, And from thir Ivorie Port the Cherubim Forth issuing at th\u2019 accustomd hour stood armd To thir night watches in warlike Parade, When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake. Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the South With strictest watch; these other wheel the North, Our circuit meets full West. As flame they part Half wheeling to the Shield, half to the Spear. From these, two strong and suttle Spirits he calld That neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge. Ithuriel and Zephon, with wingd speed Search through this Garden, leav unsearcht no nook, But chiefly where those two fair Creatures Lodge, Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme. This Eevning from the Sun\u2019s decline arriv\u2019d Who tells of som infernal Spirit seen Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap\u2019d The barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt: Such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. So saying, on he led his radiant Files, Daz\u2019ling the Moon; these to the Bower direct In search of whom they sought: him there they found Squat like a Toad, close at the eare of Eve; Assaying by his Devilish art to reach The Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams, Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint Th\u2019 animal Spirits that from pure blood arise Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise At least distemperd, discontented thoughts, Vain hopes, vain aimes, inordinate desires Blown up with high conceits ingendring pride. Him thus intent Ithuriel with his Spear Touch\u2019d lightly; for no falshood can endure Touch of Celestial temper, but returns Of force to its own likeness: up he starts Discoverd and surpriz\u2019d. As when a spark Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine With sudden blaze diffus\u2019d, inflames the Aire: So started up in his own shape the Fiend. Back stept those two fair Angels half amaz\u2019d So sudden to behold the grieslie King; Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon. Which of those rebell Spirits adjudg\u2019d to Hell Com\u2019st thou, escap\u2019d thy prison, and transform\u2019d, Why satst thou like an enemie in waite Here watching at the head of these that sleep? Know ye not then said Satan, filld with scorn, Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate For you, there sitting where ye durst not soare; Not to know mee argues your selves unknown, The lowest of your throng; or if ye know, Why ask ye, and", "superfluous begin Your message, like to end as much in vain? To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn. Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same, Or undiminisht brightness, to be known As when thou stoodst in Heav\u2019n upright and pure; That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good, Departed from thee, and thou resembl\u2019st now Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule. But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep This place inviolable, and these from harm. So spake the Cherube, and his grave rebuke Severe in youthful beautie, added grace Invincible: abasht the Devil stood, And felt how awful goodness is, and saw Vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin\u2019d His loss; but chiefly to find here observd His lustre visibly impar\u2019d; yet seemd Undaunted. If I must contend, said he, Best with the best, the Sender not the sent, Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn, Or less be lost. Thy fear, said Zephon bold, Will save us trial what the least can doe Single against thee wicked, and thence weak. The Fiend repli\u2019d not, overcome with rage; But like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on, Chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie He held it vain; awe from above had quelld His heart, not else dismai\u2019d. Now drew they nigh The western point, where those half- rounding guards Just met, & closing stood in squadron joind Awaiting next command. To whom thir Chief Gabriel from the Front thus calld aloud. O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet Hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade, And with them comes a third of Regal port, But faded splendor wan; who by his gate And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell, Not likely to part hence without contest; Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. He scarce had ended, when those two approachd And brief related whom they brought, wher found, How busied, in what form and posture coucht. To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake. Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescrib\u2019d To thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge Of others, who approve not to transgress By thy example, but have power and right To question thy bold entrance on this place; Imploi\u2019d it seems to violate sleep, and those Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss? To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow. Gabriel, thou hadst in Heav\u2019n th\u2019 esteem of wise, And such I held thee; but this question askt Puts me in doubt. Lives ther who loves his pain? Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell, Though thither doomd? Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt, And boldly venture to whatever place Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change Torment with ease, & soonest recompence Dole with delight, which in this place I sought; To thee no", "reason; who knowst only good, But evil hast not tri\u2019d: and wilt object His will who bound us? let him surer barr His Iron Gates, if he intends our stay In that dark durance: thus much what was askt. The rest is true, they found me where they say; But that implies not violence or harme. Thus hee in scorn. The warlike Angel mov\u2019d, Disdainfully half smiling thus repli\u2019d. O loss of one in Heav\u2019n to judge of wise, Since Satan fell, whom follie overthrew, And now returns him from his prison scap\u2019t, Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither Unlicenc\u2019t from his bounds in Hell prescrib\u2019d; So wise he judges it to fly from pain However, and to scape his punishment. So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth, Which thou incurr\u2019st by flying, meet thy flight Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell, Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain Can equal anger infinite provok\u2019t. But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief, The first in flight from pain, had\u2019st thou alleg\u2019d To thy deserted host this cause of flight, Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern. Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain, Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood Thy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide The blasting volied Thunder made all speed And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear. But still thy words at random, as before, Argue thy inexperience what behooves From hard assaies and ill successes past A faithful Leader, not to hazard all Through wayes of danger by himself untri\u2019d. I therefore, I alone first undertook To wing the desolate Abyss, and spie This new created World, whereof in Hell Fame is not silent, here in hope to find Better abode, and my afflicted Powers To settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire; Though for possession put to try once more What thou and thy gay Legions dare against; Whose easier business were to serve thir Lord High up in Heav\u2019n, with songs to hymne his Throne, And practis\u2019d distances to cringe, not fight. To whom the warriour Angel soon repli\u2019d. To say and strait unsay, pretending first Wise to flie pain, professing next the Spie, Argues no Leader, but a lyar trac\u2019t, Satan, and couldst thou faithful add? O name, O sacred name of faithfulness profan\u2019d! Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? Armie of Fiends, fit body to fit head; Was this your discipline and faith ingag\u2019d, Your military obedience, to dissolve Allegeance to th\u2019 acknowledg\u2019d Power supream? And thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem Patron of liberty, who more then thou Once fawn\u2019d, and cring\u2019d, and servilly ador\u2019d Heav\u2019ns awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope To dispossess him,", "and thy self to reigne? But mark what I arreede thee now, avant; Flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre Within these hallowd limits thou appeer, Back to th\u2019 infernal pit I drag thee chaind, And Seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne The facil gates of hell too slightly barrd. So threatn\u2019d hee, but Satan to no threats Gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli\u2019d. Then when I am thy captive talk of chaines, Proud limitarie Cherube, but ere then Farr heavier load thy self expect to feel From my prevailing arme, though Heavens King Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy Compeers, Us\u2019d to the yoak, draw\u2019st his triumphant wheels In progress through the rode of Heav\u2019n Star-pav\u2019d. While thus he spake, th\u2019 Angelic Squadron bright Turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes Thir Phalanx, and began to hemm him round With ported Spears, as thick as when a field Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind Swayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands Least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves Prove chaff. On th\u2019 other side Satan allarm\u2019d Collecting all his might dilated stood, Like Teneriff or Atlas unremov\u2019d: His stature reacht the Skie, and on his Crest Sat horror Plum\u2019d; nor wanted in his graspe What seemd both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds Might have ensu\u2019d, nor onely Paradise In this commotion, but the Starrie Cope Of Heav\u2019n perhaps, or all the Elements At least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne With violence of this conflict, had not soon Th\u2019 Eternal to prevent such horrid fray Hung forth in Heav\u2019n his golden Scales, yet seen Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion signe, Wherein all things created first he weighd, The pendulous round Earth with ballanc\u2019t Aire In counterpoise, now ponders all events, Battels and Realms: in these he put two weights The sequel each of parting and of fight; The latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam; Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend. Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowst mine, Neither our own but giv\u2019n; what follie then To boast what Arms can doe, since thine no more Then Heav\u2019n permits, nor mine, though doubld now To trample thee as mire: for proof look up, And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign Where thou art weigh\u2019d, & shown how light, how weak, If thou resist. The Fiend lookt up and knew His mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night. THE END OF THE FOURTH BOOK. PARADISE LOST BOOK V. Now Morn her rosie steps in th\u2019 Eastern Clime Advancing, sow\u2019d the Earth with Orient Pearle, When Adam wak\u2019t, so customd, for his sleep Was Aerie light, from pure digestion bred, And temperat vapors bland, which th\u2019 only sound Of leaves and fuming rills, Aurora\u2019s fan, Lightly dispers\u2019d, and the shrill Matin Song Of Birds on every", "bough; so much the more His wonder was to find unwak\u2019nd Eve With Tresses discompos\u2019d, and glowing Cheek, As through unquiet rest: he on his side Leaning half-rais\u2019d, with looks of cordial Love Hung over her enamour\u2019d, and beheld Beautie, which whether waking or asleep, Shot forth peculiar Graces; then with voice Milde, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes, Her hand soft touching, whisperd thus. Awake My fairest, my espous\u2019d, my latest found, Heav\u2019ns last best gift, my ever new delight, Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field Calls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring Our tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove, What drops the Myrrhe, & what the balmie Reed, How Nature paints her colours, how the Bee Sits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet. Such whispering wak\u2019d her, but with startl\u2019d eye On Adam, whom imbracing, thus she spake. O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose, My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I see Thy face, and Morn return\u2019d, for I this Night, Such night till this I never pass\u2019d, have dream\u2019d, If dream\u2019d, not as I oft am wont, of thee, Works of day pass\u2019t, or morrows next designe, But of offence and trouble, which my mind Knew never till this irksom night; methought Close at mine ear one call\u2019d me forth to walk With gentle voice, I thought it thine; it said, Why sleepst thou Eve? now is the pleasant time, The cool, the silent, save where silence yields To the night-warbling Bird, that now awake Tunes sweetest his love-labor\u2019d song; now reignes Full Orb\u2019d the Moon, and with more pleasing light Shadowie sets off the face of things; in vain, If none regard; Heav\u2019n wakes with all his eyes, Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire, In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze. I rose as at thy call, but found thee not; To find thee I directed then my walk; And on, methought, alone I pass\u2019d through ways That brought me on a sudden to the Tree Of interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem\u2019d, Much fairer to my Fancie then by day: And as I wondring lookt, beside it stood One shap\u2019d & wing\u2019d like one of those from Heav\u2019n By us oft seen; his dewie locks distill\u2019d Ambrosia; on that Tree he also gaz\u2019d; And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg\u2019d, Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet, Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis\u2019d? Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste? Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold Longer thy offerd good, why else set here? This said he paus\u2019d not, but with ventrous Arme He pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil\u2019d At such bold words voucht with a deed so bold: But he thus overjoy\u2019d, O Fruit Divine, Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt, Forbidd\u2019n here, it seems, as onely fit For Gods, yet able", "to make Gods of Men: And why not Gods of Men, since good, the more Communicated, more abundant growes, The Author not impair\u2019d, but honourd more? Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic Eve, Partake thou also; happie though thou art, Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be: Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods Thy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind, But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimes Ascend to Heav\u2019n, by merit thine, and see What life the Gods live there, and such live thou. So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held, Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part Which he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smell So quick\u2019nd appetite, that I, methought, Could not but taste. Forthwith up to the Clouds With him I flew, and underneath beheld The Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide And various: wondring at my flight and change To this high exaltation; suddenly My Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down, And fell asleep; but O how glad I wak\u2019d To find this but a dream! Thus Eve her Night Related, and thus Adam answerd sad. Best Image of my self and dearer half, The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep Affects me equally; nor can I like This uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear; Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none, Created pure. But know that in the Soule Are many lesser Faculties that serve Reason as chief; among these Fansie next Her office holds; of all external things, Which the five watchful Senses represent, She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes, Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, frames All what we affirm or what deny, and call Our knowledge or opinion; then retires Into her private Cell when Nature rests. Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakes To imitate her; but misjoyning shapes, Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams, Ill matching words and deeds long past or late. Som such resemblances methinks I find Of our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream, But with addition strange; yet be not sad. Evil into the mind of God or Man May come and go, so unapprov\u2019d, and leave No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope That what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream, Waking thou never wilt consent to do. Be not disheart\u2019nd then, nor cloud those looks That wont to be more chearful and serene Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World, And let us to our fresh imployments rise Among the Groves, the Fountains, and the Flours That open now thir choicest bosom\u2019d smells Reservd from night, and kept for thee in store. So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard, But silently a gentle tear let fall From either eye, and wip\u2019d them with her haire; Two other precious drops that ready stood, Each in thir chrystal sluce, hee ere they fell Kiss\u2019d as the gracious signs of sweet", "remorse And pious awe, that feard to have offended. So all was cleard, and to the Field they haste. But first from under shadie arborous roof, Soon as they forth were come to open sight Of day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risen With wheels yet hov\u2019ring o\u2019re the Ocean brim, Shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray, Discovering in wide Lantskip all the East Of Paradise and Edens happie Plains, Lowly they bow\u2019d adoring, and began Thir Orisons, each Morning duly paid In various style, for neither various style Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise Thir Maker, in fit strains pronounc\u2019t or sung Unmeditated, such prompt eloquence Flowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse, More tuneable then needed Lute or Harp To add more sweetness, and they thus began. These are thy glorious works, Parent of good, Almightie, thine this universal Frame, Thus wondrous fair; thy self how wondrous then! Unspeakable, who sitst above these Heavens To us invisible or dimly seen In these thy lowest works, yet these declare Thy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine: Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light, Angels, for yee behold him, and with songs And choral symphonies, Day without Night, Circle his Throne rejoycing, yee in Heav\u2019n, On Earth joyn all yee Creatures to extoll Him first, him last, him midst, and without end. Fairest of Starrs, last in the train of Night, If better thou belong not to the dawn, Sure pledge of day, that crownst the smiling Morn With thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy Spheare While day arises, that sweet hour of Prime. Thou Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soule, Acknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praise In thy eternal course, both when thou climb\u2019st, And when high Noon hast gaind, & when thou fallst. Moon, that now meetst the orient Sun, now fli\u2019st With the fixt Starrs, fixt in thir Orb that flies, And yee five other wandring Fires that move In mystic Dance not without Song, resound His praise, who out of Darkness call\u2019d up Light. Aire, and ye Elements the eldest birth Of Natures Womb, that in quaternion run Perpetual Circle, multiform; and mix And nourish all things, let your ceasless change Varie to our great Maker still new praise. Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise From Hill or steaming Lake, duskie or grey, Till the Sun paint your fleecie skirts with Gold, In honour to the Worlds great Author rise, Whether to deck with Clouds the uncolourd skie, Or wet the thirstie Earth with falling showers, Rising or falling still advance his praise. His praise ye Winds, that from four Quarters blow, Breath soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines, With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave. Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow, Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise. Joyn voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds, That singing up to Heaven Gate ascend, Bear on", "your wings and in your notes his praise; Yee that in Waters glide, and yee that walk The Earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep; Witness if I be silent, Morn or Eeven, To Hill, or Valley, Fountain, or fresh shade Made vocal by my Song, and taught his praise. Hail universal Lord, be bounteous still To give us onely good; and if the night Have gathered aught of evil or conceald, Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark. So pray\u2019d they innocent, and to thir thoughts Firm peace recoverd soon and wonted calm. On to thir mornings rural work they haste Among sweet dewes and flours; where any row Of Fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too farr Thir pamperd boughes, and needed hands to check Fruitless imbraces: or they led the Vine To wed her Elm; she spous\u2019d about him twines Her mariageable arms, and with her brings Her dowr th\u2019 adopted Clusters, to adorn His barren leaves. Them thus imploid beheld With pittie Heav\u2019ns high King, and to him call\u2019d Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deign\u2019d To travel with Tobias, and secur\u2019d His marriage with the seaventimes-wedded Maid. Raphael, said hee, thou hear\u2019st what stir on Earth Satan from Hell scap\u2019t through the darksom Gulf Hath raisd in Paradise, and how disturbd This night the human pair, how he designes In them at once to ruin all mankind. Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend Converse with Adam, in what Bowre or shade Thou find\u2019st him from the heat of Noon retir\u2019d, To respit his day-labour with repast, Or with repose; and such discourse bring on, As may advise him of his happie state, Happiness in his power left free to will, Left to his own free Will, his Will though free, Yet mutable; whence warne him to beware He swerve not too secure: tell him withall His danger, and from whom, what enemie Late falln himself from Heav\u2019n, is plotting now The fall of others from like state of bliss; By violence, no, for that shall be withstood, But by deceit and lies; this let him know, Least wilfully transgressing he pretend Surprisal, unadmonisht, unforewarnd. So spake th\u2019 Eternal Father, and fulfilld All Justice: nor delaid the winged Saint After his charge receivd, but from among Thousand Celestial Ardors, where he stood Vaild with his gorgeous wings, up springing light Flew through the midst of Heav\u2019n; th\u2019 angelic Quires On each hand parting, to his speed gave way Through all th\u2019 Empyreal road; till at the Gate Of Heav\u2019n arriv\u2019d, the gate self-opend wide On golden Hinges turning, as by work Divine the sov\u2019ran Architect had fram\u2019d. From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight, Starr interpos\u2019d, however small he sees, Not unconform to other shining Globes, Earth and the Gard\u2019n of God, with Cedars crownd Above all Hills. As when by night the Glass Of Galileo, less assur\u2019d, observes Imagind Lands and Regions in the Moon: Or Pilot from amidst the Cyclades Delos or", "Samos first appeering kenns A cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flight He speeds, and through the vast Ethereal Skie Sailes between worlds & worlds, with steddie wing Now on the polar windes, then with quick Fann Winnows the buxom Air; till within soare Of Towring Eagles, to all the Fowles he seems A Phoenix, gaz\u2019d by all, as that sole Bird When to enshrine his reliques in the Sun\u2019s Bright Temple, to Aegyptian Theb\u2019s he flies. At once on th\u2019 Eastern cliff of Paradise He lights, and to his proper shape returns A Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shade His lineaments Divine; the pair that clad Each shoulder broad, came mantling o\u2019re his brest With regal Ornament; the middle pair Girt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and round Skirted his loines and thighes with downie Gold And colours dipt in Heav\u2019n; the third his feet Shaddowd from either heele with featherd maile Skie-tinctur\u2019d grain. Like Maia\u2019s son he stood, And shook his Plumes, that Heav\u2019nly fragrance filld The circuit wide. Strait knew him all the bands Of Angels under watch; and to his state, And to his message high in honour rise; For on som message high they guessd him bound. Thir glittering Tents he passd, and now is come Into the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrhe, And flouring Odours, Cassia, Nard, and Balme; A Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here Wantond as in her prime, and plaid at will Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet, Wilde above rule or art; enormous bliss. Him through the spicie Forrest onward com Adam discernd, as in the dore he sat Of his coole Bowre, while now the mounted Sun Shot down direct his fervid Raies, to warme Earths inmost womb, more warmth then Adam need; And Eve within, due at her hour prepar\u2019d For dinner savourie fruits, of taste to please True appetite, and not disrelish thirst Of nectarous draughts between, from milkie stream, Berrie or Grape: to whom thus Adam call\u2019d. Haste hither Eve, and worth thy sight behold Eastward among those Trees, what glorious shape Comes this way moving; seems another Morn Ris\u2019n on mid-noon; som great behest from Heav\u2019n To us perhaps he brings, and will voutsafe This day to be our Guest. But goe with speed, And what thy stores contain, bring forth and poure Abundance, fit to honour and receive Our Heav\u2019nly stranger; well we may afford Our givers thir own gifts, and large bestow From large bestowd, where Nature multiplies Her fertil growth, and by disburd\u2019ning grows More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare. To whom thus Eve. Adam, earths hallowd mould, Of God inspir\u2019d, small store will serve, where store, All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk; Save what by frugal storing firmness gains To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes: But I will haste and from each bough and break, Each Plant & juciest Gourd will pluck such choice To entertain our Angel guest, as hee", "Beholding shall confess that here on Earth God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav\u2019n. So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent What choice to chuse for delicacie best, What order, so contriv\u2019d as not to mix Tastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bring Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change, Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yeilds In India East or West, or middle shoare In Pontus or the Punic Coast, or where Alcinous reign\u2019d, fruit of all kindes, in coate, Rough, or smooth rin\u2019d, or bearded husk, or shell She gathers, Tribute large, and on the board Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the Grape She crushes, inoffensive moust, and meathes From many a berrie, and from sweet kernels prest She tempers dulcet creams, nor these to hold Wants her fit vessels pure, then strews the ground With Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum\u2019d. Mean while our Primitive great Sire, to meet His god-like Guest, walks forth, without more train Accompani\u2019d then with his own compleat Perfections, in himself was all his state, More solemn then the tedious pomp that waits On Princes, when thir rich Retinue long Of Horses led, and Grooms besmeard with Gold Dazles the croud, and sets them all agape. Neerer his presence Adam though not awd, Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek, As to a superior Nature, bowing low, Thus said. Native of Heav\u2019n, for other place None can then Heav\u2019n such glorious shape contain; Since by descending from the Thrones above, Those happie places thou hast deignd a while To want, and honour these, voutsafe with us Two onely, who yet by sov\u2019ran gift possess This spacious ground, in yonder shadie Bowre To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears To sit and taste, till this meridian heat Be over, and the Sun more coole decline. Whom thus the Angelic Vertue answerd milde. Adam, I therefore came, nor art thou such Created, or such place hast here to dwell, As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heav\u2019n To visit thee; lead on then where thy Bowre Oreshades; for these mid-hours, till Eevning rise I have at will. So to the Silvan Lodge They came, that like Pomona\u2019s Arbour smil\u2019d With flourets deck\u2019t and fragrant smells; but Eve Undeckt, save with her self more lovely fair Then Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feign\u2019d Of three that in Mount Ida naked strove, Stood to entertain her guest from Heav\u2019n; no vaile Shee needed, Vertue-proof, no thought infirme Alterd her cheek. On whom the Angel Haile Bestowd, the holy salutation us\u2019d Long after to blest Marie, second Eve. Haile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons Then with these various fruits the Trees of God Have heap\u2019d this Table. Rais\u2019d of grassie terf Thir Table was, and mossie seats had round, And on her ample Square from side to side All Autumn", "pil\u2019d, though Spring and Autumn here Danc\u2019d hand in hand. A while discourse they hold; No fear lest Dinner coole; when thus began Our Authour. Heav\u2019nly stranger, please to taste These bounties which our Nourisher, from whom All perfet good unmeasur\u2019d out, descends, To us for food and for delight hath caus\u2019d The Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps To spiritual Natures; only this I know, That one Celestial Father gives to all. To whom the Angel. Therefore what he gives (Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found No ingrateful food: and food alike those pure Intelligential substances require As doth your Rational; and both contain Within them every lower facultie Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste, Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate, And corporeal to incorporeal turn. For know, whatever was created, needs To be sustaind and fed; of Elements The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea, Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon; Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurg\u2019d Vapours not yet into her substance turnd. Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale From her moist Continent to higher Orbes. The Sun that light imparts to all, receives From all his alimental recompence In humid exhalations, and at Even Sups with the Ocean: though in Heav\u2019n the Trees Of life ambrosial frutage bear, and vines Yeild Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn We brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the ground Cover\u2019d with pearly grain: yet God hath here Varied his bounty so with new delights, As may compare with Heaven; and to taste Think not I shall be nice. So down they sat, And to thir viands fell, nor seemingly The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss Of Theologians, but with keen dispatch Of real hunger, and concoctive heate To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire Of sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist Can turn, or holds it possible to turn Metals of drossiest Ore to perfet Gold As from the Mine. Mean while at Table Eve Ministerd naked, and thir flowing cups With pleasant liquors crown\u2019d: O innocence Deserving Paradise! if ever, then, Then had the Sons of God excuse to have bin Enamour\u2019d at that sight; but in those hearts Love unlibidinous reign\u2019d, nor jealousie Was understood, the injur\u2019d Lovers Hell. Thus when with meats & drinks they had suffic\u2019d, Not burd\u2019nd Nature, sudden mind arose In Adam, not to let th\u2019 occasion pass Given him by this great Conference to know Of things above his World, and of thir being Who dwell in Heav\u2019n, whose excellence he saw Transcend his own so farr, whose radiant forms Divine effulgence, whose high Power so far Exceeded human, and his wary speech Thus to th\u2019 Empyreal Minister he fram\u2019d. Inhabitant with God, now know I well Thy favour, in this honour done to man, Under whose", "lowly roof thou hast voutsaf\u2019t To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste, Food not of Angels, yet accepted so, As that more willingly thou couldst not seem At Heav\u2019ns high feasts to have fed: yet what compare? To whom the winged Hierarch repli\u2019d. O Adam, one Almightie is, from whom All things proceed, and up to him return, If not deprav\u2019d from good, created all Such to perfection, one first matter all, Indu\u2019d with various forms, various degrees Of substance, and in things that live, of life; But more refin\u2019d, more spiritous, and pure, As neerer to him plac\u2019t or neerer tending Each in thir several active Sphears assignd, Till body up to spirit work, in bounds Proportiond to each kind. So from the root Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves More aerie, last the bright consummate floure Spirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruit Mans nourishment, by gradual scale sublim\u2019d To vital Spirits aspire, to animal, To intellectual, give both life and sense, Fansie and understanding, whence the soule Reason receives, and reason is her being, Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours, Differing but in degree, of kind the same. Wonder not then, what God for you saw good If I refuse not, but convert, as you, To proper substance; time may come when men With Angels may participate, and find No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare: And from these corporal nutriments perhaps Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit Improv\u2019d by tract of time, and wingd ascend Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice Here or in Heav\u2019nly Paradises dwell; If ye be found obedient, and retain Unalterably firm his love entire Whose progenie you are. Mean while enjoy Your fill what happiness this happie state Can comprehend, incapable of more. To whom the Patriarch of mankind repli\u2019d. O favourable spirit, propitious guest, Well hast thou taught the way that might direct Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set From center to circumference, whereon In contemplation of created things By steps we may ascend to God. But say, What meant that caution joind, If ye be found obedient? can wee want obedience then To him, or possibly his love desert Who formd us from the dust, and plac\u2019d us here Full to the utmost measure of what bliss Human desires can seek or apprehend? To whom the Angel. Son of Heav\u2019n and Earth, Attend: That thou art happie, owe to God; That thou continu\u2019st such, owe to thy self, That is, to thy obedience; therein stand. This was that caution giv\u2019n thee; be advis\u2019d. God made thee perfet, not immutable; And good he made thee, but to persevere He left it in thy power, ordaind thy will By nature free, not over-rul\u2019d by Fate Inextricable, or strict necessity; Our voluntarie service he requires, Not our necessitated, such with him Findes no acceptance, nor can find, for how Can hearts, not free, be tri\u2019d whether", "they serve Willing or no, who will but what they must By Destinie, and can no other choose? My self and all th\u2019 Angelic Host that stand In sight of God enthron\u2019d, our happie state Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds; On other surety none; freely we serve. Because wee freely love, as in our will To love or not; in this we stand or fall: And som are fall\u2019n, to disobedience fall\u2019n, And so from Heav\u2019n to deepest Hell; O fall From what high state of bliss into what woe! To whom our great Progenitor. Thy words Attentive, and with more delighted eare Divine instructer, I have heard, then when Cherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills Aereal Music send: nor knew I not To be both will and deed created free; Yet that we never shall forget to love Our maker, and obey him whose command Single, is yet so just, my constant thoughts Assur\u2019d me and still assure: though what thou tellst Hath past in Heav\u2019n, som doubt within me move, But more desire to hear, if thou consent, The full relation, which must needs be strange, Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard; And we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun Hath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins His other half in the great Zone of Heav\u2019n. Thus Adam made request, and Raphael After short pause assenting, thus began. High matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men, Sad task and hard, for how shall I relate To human sense th\u2019 invisible exploits Of warring Spirits; how without remorse The ruin of so many glorious once And perfet while they stood; how last unfould The secrets of another world, perhaps Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good This is dispenc\u2019t, and what surmounts the reach Of human sense, I shall delineate so, By lik\u2019ning spiritual to corporal forms, As may express them best, though what if Earth Be but the shaddow of Heav\u2019n, and things therein Each to other like, more then on earth is thought? As yet this world was not, and Chaos wilde Reignd where these Heav\u2019ns now rowl, where Earth now rests Upon her Center pois\u2019d, when on a day (For Time, though in Eternitie, appli\u2019d To motion, measures all things durable By present, past, and future) on such day As Heav\u2019ns great Year brings forth, th\u2019 Empyreal Host Of Angels by Imperial summons call\u2019d, Innumerable before th\u2019 Almighties Throne Forthwith from all the ends of Heav\u2019n appeerd Under thir Hierarchs in orders bright Ten thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc\u2019d, Standards, and Gonfalons twixt Van and Reare Streame in the Aire, and for distinction serve Of Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees; Or in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz\u2019d Holy Memorials, acts of Zeale and Love Recorded eminent. Thus when in Orbes Of circuit inexpressible they stood, Orb within Orb, the Father infinite, By whom in bliss imbosom\u2019d sat the Son, Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whoseop", "Brightness had made invisible, thus spake. Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light, Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, Hear my Decree, which unrevok\u2019t shall stand. This day I have begot whom I declare My onely Son, and on this holy Hill Him have anointed, whom ye now behold At my right hand; your Head I him appoint; And by my Self have sworn to him shall bow All knees in Heav\u2019n, and shall confess him Lord: Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abide United as one individual Soule For ever happie: him who disobeyes Mee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls Into utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place Ordaind without redemption, without end. So spake th\u2019 Omnipotent, and with his words All seemd well pleas\u2019d, all seem\u2019d, but were not all. That day, as other solem dayes, they spent In song and dance about the sacred Hill, Mystical dance, which yonder starrie Spheare Of Planets and of fixt in all her Wheeles Resembles nearest, mazes intricate, Eccentric, intervolv\u2019d, yet regular Then most, when most irregular they seem: And in thir motions harmonie Divine So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear Listens delighted. Eevning approachd (For we have also our Eevning and our Morn, We ours for change delectable, not need) Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn Desirous, all in Circles as they stood, Tables are set, and on a sudden pil\u2019d With Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flows: In Pearl, in Diamond, and massie Gold, Fruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heav\u2019n. They eat, they drink, and with refection sweet Are fill\u2019d, before th\u2019 all bounteous King, who showrd With copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy. Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhal\u2019d From that high mount of God, whence light & shade Spring both, the face of brightest Heav\u2019n had changd To grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there In darker veile) and roseat Dews dispos\u2019d All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest, Wide over all the Plain, and wider farr Then all this globous Earth in Plain outspred, (Such are the Courts of God) Th\u2019 Angelic throng Disperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extend By living Streams among the Trees of Life, Pavilions numberless, and sudden reard, Celestial Tabernacles, where they slept Fannd with coole Winds, save those who in thir course Melodious Hymns about the sovran Throne Alternate all night long: but not so wak\u2019d Satan, so call him now, his former name Is heard no more Heav\u2019n; he of the first, If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power, In favour and praeeminence, yet fraught With envie against the Son of God, that day Honourd by his great Father, and proclaimd Messiah King anointed, could not beare Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaird. Deep malice thence conceiving & disdain, Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houre Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv\u2019d With all his Legions to", "dislodge, and leave Unworshipt, unobey\u2019d the Throne supream Contemptuous, and his next subordinate Awak\u2019ning, thus to him in secret spake. Sleepst thou Companion dear, what sleep can close Thy eye-lids? and remembrest what Decree Of yesterday, so late hath past the lips Of Heav\u2019ns Almightie. Thou to me thy thoughts Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart; Both waking we were one; how then can now Thy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest impos\u2019d; New Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise In us who serve, new Counsels, to debate What doubtful may ensue, more in this place To utter is not safe. Assemble thou Of all those Myriads which we lead the chief; Tell them that by command, ere yet dim Night Her shadowie Cloud withdraws, I am to haste, And all who under me thir Banners wave, Homeward with flying march where we possess The Quarters of the North, there to prepare Fit entertainment to receive our King The great Messiah, and his new commands, Who speedily through all the Hierarchies Intends to pass triumphant, and give Laws. So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus\u2019d Bad influence into th\u2019 unwarie brest Of his Associate; hee together calls, Or several one by one, the Regent Powers, Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught, That the most High commanding, now ere Night, Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav\u2019n, The great Hierarchal Standard was to move; Tells the suggested cause, and casts between Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound Or taint integritie; but all obey\u2019d The wonted signal, and superior voice Of thir great Potentate; for great indeed His name, and high was his degree in Heav\u2019n; His count\u2019nance, as the Morning Starr that guides The starrie flock, allur\u2019d them, and with lyes Drew after him the third part of Heav\u2019ns Host: Mean while th\u2019 Eternal eye, whose sight discernes Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount And from within the golden Lamps that burne Nightly before him, saw without thir light Rebellion rising, saw in whom, how spred Among the sons of Morn, what multitudes Were banded to oppose his high Decree; And smiling to his onely Son thus said. Son, thou in whom my glory I behold In full resplendence, Heir of all my might, Neerly it now concernes us to be sure Of our Omnipotence, and with what Arms We mean to hold what anciently we claim Of Deitie or Empire, such a foe Is rising, who intends to erect his Throne Equal to ours, throughout the spacious North; Nor so content, hath in his thought to trie In battel, what our Power is, or our right. Let us advise, and to this hazard draw With speed what force is left, and all imploy In our defence, lest unawares we lose This our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill. To whom the Son with calm aspect and cleer Light\u2019ning Divine, ineffable, serene, Made answer. Mightie Father, thou thy foes Justly hast", "in derision, and secure Laugh\u2019st at thir vain designes and tumults vain, Matter to mee of Glory, whom thir hate Illustrates, when they see all Regal Power Giv\u2019n me to quell thir pride, and in event Know whether I be dextrous to subdue Thy Rebels, or be found the worst in Heav\u2019n. So spake the Son, but Satan with his Powers Farr was advanc\u2019t on winged speed, an Host Innumerable as the Starrs of Night, Or Starrs of Morning, Dew-drops, which the Sun Impearls on every leaf and every flouer. Regions they pass\u2019d, the mightie Regencies Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones In thir triple Degrees, Regions to which All thy Dominion, Adam, is no more Then what this Garden is to all the Earth, And all the Sea, from one entire globose Stretcht into Longitude; which having pass\u2019d At length into the limits of the North They came, and Satan to his Royal seat High on a Hill, far blazing, as a Mount Rais\u2019d on a Mount, with Pyramids and Towrs From Diamond Quarries hew\u2019n, & Rocks of Gold, The Palace of great Lucifer, (so call That Structure in the Dialect of men Interpreted) which not long after, hee Affecting all equality with God, In imitation of that Mount whereon Messiah was declar\u2019d in sight of Heav\u2019n, The Mountain of the Congregation call\u2019d; For thither he assembl\u2019d all his Train, Pretending so commanded to consult About the great reception of thir King, Thither to come, and with calumnious Art Of counterfeted truth thus held thir ears. Thrones, Dominations, Princedomes, Vertues, Powers, If these magnific Titles yet remain Not meerly titular, since by Decree Another now hath to himself ingross\u2019t All Power, and us eclipst under the name Of King anointed, for whom all this haste Of midnight march, and hurried meeting here, This onely to consult how we may best With what may be devis\u2019d of honours new Receive him coming to receive from us Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile, Too much to one, but double how endur\u2019d, To one and to his image now proclaim\u2019d? But what if better counsels might erect Our minds and teach us to cast off this Yoke? Will ye submit your necks, and chuse to bend The supple knee? ye will not, if I trust To know ye right, or if ye know your selves Natives and Sons of Heav\u2019n possest before By none, and if not equal all, yet free, Equally free; for Orders and Degrees Jarr not with liberty, but well consist. Who can in reason then or right assume Monarchie over such as live by right His equals, if in power and splendor less, In freedome equal? or can introduce Law and Edict on us, who without law Erre not, much less for this to be our Lord, And look for adoration to th\u2019 abuse Of those Imperial Titles which assert Our being ordain\u2019d to govern, not to serve? Thus farr his bold discourse without controule Had audience, when among", "the Seraphim Abdiel, then whom none with more zeale ador\u2019d The Deitie, and divine commands obei\u2019d, Stood up, and in a flame of zeale severe The current of his fury thus oppos\u2019d. O argument blasphemous, false and proud! Words which no eare ever to hear in Heav\u2019n Expected, least of all from thee, ingrate In place thy self so high above thy Peeres. Canst thou with impious obloquie condemne The just Decree of God, pronounc\u2019t and sworn, That to his only Son by right endu\u2019d With Regal Scepter, every Soule in Heav\u2019n Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due Confess him rightful King? unjust thou saist Flatly unjust, to binde with Laws the free, And equal over equals to let Reigne, One over all with unsucceeded power. Shalt thou give Law to God, shalt thou dispute With him the points of libertie, who made Thee what thou art, & formd the Pow\u2019rs of Heav\u2019n Such as he pleasd, and circumscrib\u2019d thir being? Yet by experience taught we know how good, And of our good, and of our dignitie How provident he is, how farr from thought To make us less, bent rather to exalt Our happie state under one Head more neer United. But to grant it thee unjust, That equal over equals Monarch Reigne: Thy self though great & glorious dost thou count, Or all Angelic Nature joind in one, Equal to him begotten Son, by whom As by his Word the mighty Father made All things, ev\u2019n thee, and all the Spirits of Heav\u2019n By him created in thir bright degrees, Crownd them with Glory, & to thir Glory nam\u2019d Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers Essential Powers, nor by his Reign obscur\u2019d, But more illustrious made, since he the Head One of our number thus reduc\u2019t becomes, His Laws our Laws, all honour to him done Returns our own. Cease then this impious rage, And tempt not these; but hast\u2019n to appease Th\u2019 incensed Father, and th\u2019 incensed Son, While Pardon may be found in time besought. So spake the fervent Angel, but his zeale None seconded, as out of season judg\u2019d, Or singular and rash, whereat rejoic\u2019d Th\u2019 Apostat, and more haughty thus repli\u2019d. That we were formd then saist thou? & the work Of secondarie hands, by task transferd From Father to his Son? strange point and new! Doctrin which we would know whence learnt: who saw When this creation was? rememberst thou Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being? We know no time when we were not as now; Know none before us, self-begot, self-rais\u2019d By our own quick\u2019ning power, when fatal course Had circl\u2019d his full Orbe, the birth mature Of this our native Heav\u2019n, Ethereal Sons. Our puissance is our own, our own right hand Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try Who is our equal: then thou shalt behold Whether by supplication we intend Address, and to begirt th\u2019 Almighty Throne Beseeching or besieging. This report, These", "tidings carrie to th\u2019 anointed King; And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight. He said, and as the sound of waters deep Hoarce murmur echo\u2019d to his words applause Through the infinite Host, nor less for that The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone Encompass\u2019d round with foes, thus answerd bold. O alienate from God, O spirit accurst, Forsak\u2019n of all good; I see thy fall Determind, and thy hapless crew involv\u2019d In this perfidious fraud, contagion spred Both of thy crime and punishment: henceforth No more be troubl\u2019d how to quit the yoke Of Gods Messiah; those indulgent Laws Will not be now voutsaf\u2019t, other Decrees Against thee are gon forth without recall; That Golden Scepter which thou didst reject Is now an Iron Rod to bruise and breake Thy disobedience. Well thou didst advise, Yet not for thy advise or threats I fly These wicked Tents devoted, least the wrauth Impendent, raging into sudden flame Distinguish not: for soon expect to feel His Thunder on thy head, devouring fire. Then who created thee lamenting learne, When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know. So spake the Seraph Abdiel faithful found, Among the faithless, faithful only hee; Among innumerable false, unmov\u2019d, Unshak\u2019n, unseduc\u2019d, unterrifi\u2019d His Loyaltie he kept, his Love, his Zeale; Nor number, nor example with him wrought To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind Though single. From amidst them forth he passd, Long way through hostile scorn, which he susteind Superior, nor of violence fear\u2019d aught; And with retorted scorn his back he turn\u2019d On those proud Towrs to swift destruction doom\u2019d. THE END OF THE FIFTH BOOK. PARADISE LOST BOOK VI. All night the dreadless Angel unpursu\u2019d Through Heav\u2019ns wide Champain held his way, till Morn, Wak\u2019t by the circling Hours, with rosie hand Unbarr\u2019d the gates of Light. There is a Cave Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne, Where light and darkness in perpetual round Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heav\u2019n Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night; Light issues forth, and at the other dore Obsequious darkness enters, till her houre To veile the Heav\u2019n, though darkness there might well Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn Such as in highest Heav\u2019n, arrayd in Gold Empyreal, from before her vanisht Night, Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain Coverd with thick embatteld Squadrons bright, Chariots and flaming Armes, and fierie Steeds Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view: Warr he perceav\u2019d, warr in procinct, and found Already known what he for news had thought To have reported: gladly then he mixt Among those friendly Powers who him receav\u2019d With joy and acclamations loud, that one That of so many Myriads fall\u2019n, yet one Returnd not lost: On to the sacred hill They led him high applauded, and present Before the seat supream; from whence a voice From midst a Golden Cloud thus milde was heard. Servant of God, well done, well hast thou", "fought The better fight, who single hast maintaind Against revolted multitudes the Cause Of Truth, in word mightier then they in Armes; And for the testimonie of Truth hast born Universal reproach, far worse to beare Then violence: for this was all thy care To stand approv\u2019d in sight of God, though Worlds Judg\u2019d thee perverse: the easier conquest now Remains thee, aided by this host of friends, Back on thy foes more glorious to return Then scornd thou didst depart, and to subdue By force, who reason for thir Law refuse, Right reason for thir Law, and for thir King Messiah, who by right of merit Reigns. Goe Michael of Celestial Armies Prince, And thou in Military prowess next Gabriel, lead forth to Battel these my Sons Invincible, lead forth my armed Saints By Thousands and by Millions rang\u2019d for fight; Equal in number to that Godless crew Rebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms Fearless assault, and to the brow of Heav\u2019n Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss, Into thir place of punishment, the Gulf Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide His fiery Chaos to receave thir fall. So spake the Sovran voice, and Clouds began To darken all the Hill, and smoak to rowl In duskie wreathes, reluctant flames, the signe Of wrauth awak\u2019t: nor with less dread the loud Ethereal Trumpet from on high gan blow: At which command the Powers Militant, That stood for Heav\u2019n, in mighty Quadrate joyn\u2019d Of Union irresistible, mov\u2019d on In silence thir bright Legions, to the sound Of instrumental Harmonie that breath\u2019d Heroic Ardor to advent\u2019rous deeds Under thir God-like Leaders, in the Cause Of God and his Messiah. On they move Indissolubly firm; nor obvious Hill, Nor streit\u2019ning Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides Thir perfet ranks; for high above the ground Thir march was, and the passive Air upbore Thir nimble tread; as when the total kind Of Birds in orderly array on wing Came summond over Eden to receive Thir names of thee; so over many a tract Of Heav\u2019n they march\u2019d, and many a Province wide Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last Farr in th\u2019 Horizon to the North appeer\u2019d From skirt to skirt a fierie Region, stretcht In battailous aspect, and neerer view Bristl\u2019d with upright beams innumerable Of rigid Spears, and Helmets throng\u2019d, and Shields Various, with boastful Argument portraid, The banded Powers of Satan hasting on With furious expedition; for they weend That self same day by fight, or by surprize To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne To set the envier of his State, the proud Aspirer, but thir thoughts prov\u2019d fond and vain In the mid way: though strange to us it seemd At first, that Angel should with Angel warr, And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet So oft in Festivals of joy and love Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire Hymning th\u2019 Eternal Father: but the shout Of Battel", "now began, and rushing sound Of onset ended soon each milder thought. High in the midst exalted as a God Th\u2019 Apostat in his Sun-bright Chariot sate Idol of Majestie Divine, enclos\u2019d With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields; Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now \u2019Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left, A dreadful interval, and Front to Front Presented stood in terrible array Of hideous length: before the cloudie Van, On the rough edge of battel ere it joyn\u2019d, Satan with vast and haughtie strides advanc\u2019t, Came towring, armd in Adamant and Gold; Abdiel that sight endur\u2019d not, where he stood Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds, And thus his own undaunted heart explores. O Heav\u2019n! that such resemblance of the Highest Should yet remain, where faith and realtie Remain not; wherfore should not strength & might There fail where Vertue fails, or weakest prove Where boldest; though to sight unconquerable? His puissance, trusting in th\u2019 Almightie\u2019s aide, I mean to try, whose Reason I have tri\u2019d Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just, That he who in debate of Truth hath won, Should win in Arms, in both disputes alike Victor; though brutish that contest and foule, When Reason hath to deal with force, yet so Most reason is that Reason overcome. So pondering, and from his armed Peers Forth stepping opposite, half way he met His daring foe, at this prevention more Incens\u2019t, and thus securely him defi\u2019d. Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reacht The highth of thy aspiring unoppos\u2019d, The Throne of God unguarded, and his side Abandond at the terror of thy Power Or potent tongue; fool, not to think how vain Against th\u2019 Omnipotent to rise in Arms; Who out of smallest things could without end Have rais\u2019d incessant Armies to defeat Thy folly; or with solitarie hand Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow Unaided could have finisht thee, and whelmd Thy Legions under darkness; but thou seest All are not of thy Train; there be who Faith Prefer, and Pietie to God, though then To thee not visible, when I alone Seemd in thy World erroneous to dissent From all: my Sect thou seest, now learn too late How few somtimes may know, when thousands err. Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance Thus answerd. Ill for thee, but in wisht houre Of my revenge, first sought for thou returnst From flight, seditious Angel, to receave Thy merited reward, the first assay Of this right hand provok\u2019t, since first that tongue Inspir\u2019d with contradiction durst oppose A third part of the Gods, in Synod met Thir Deities to assert, who while they feel Vigour Divine within them, can allow Omnipotence to none. But well thou comst Before thy fellows, ambitious to win From me som Plume, that thy success may show Destruction to the rest: this pause between (Unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know; At first I thought that", "Libertie and Heav\u2019n To heav\u2019nly Soules had bin all one; but now I see that most through sloth had rather serve, Ministring Spirits, traind up in Feast and Song; Such hast thou arm\u2019d, the Minstrelsie of Heav\u2019n, Servilitie with freedom to contend, As both thir deeds compar\u2019d this day shall prove. To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern repli\u2019d. Apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find Of erring, from the path of truth remote: Unjustly thou deprav\u2019st it with the name Of Servitude to serve whom God ordains, Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same, When he who rules is worthiest, and excells Them whom he governs. This is servitude, To serve th\u2019 unwise, or him who hath rebelld Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee, Thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall\u2019d; Yet leudly dar\u2019st our ministring upbraid. Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve In Heav\u2019n God ever blessed, and his Divine Behests obey, worthiest to be obey\u2019d, Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while From mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight, This greeting on thy impious Crest receive. So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high, Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell On the proud Crest of Satan, that no sight, Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge He back recoild; the tenth on bended knee His massie Spear upstaid; as if on Earth Winds under ground or waters forcing way Sidelong, had push\u2019t a Mountain from his seat Half sunk with all his Pines. Amazement seis\u2019d The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see Thus foil\u2019d thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout, Presage of Victorie and fierce desire Of Battel: whereat Michael bid sound Th\u2019 Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heav\u2019n It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung Hosanna to the Highest: nor stood at gaze The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joyn\u2019d The horrid shock: now storming furie rose, And clamour such as heard in Heav\u2019n till now Was never, Arms on Armour clashing bray\u2019d Horrible discord, and the madding Wheeles Of brazen Chariots rag\u2019d; dire was the noise Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss Of fiery Darts in flaming volies flew, And flying vaulted either Host with fire. Sounder fierie Cope together rush\u2019d Both Battels maine, with ruinous assault And inextinguishable rage; all Heav\u2019n Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth Had to her Center shook. What wonder? when Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought On either side, the least of whom could weild These Elements, and arm him with the force Of all thir Regions: how much more of Power Armie against Armie numberless to raise Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb, Though not destroy, thir happie Native seat; Had not th\u2019 Eternal King Omnipotent From his strong hold of Heav\u2019n high over-rul\u2019d And limited thir might; though numberd such As each divided Legion might have seemd A", "numerous Host, in strength each armed hand A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemd Each Warriour single as in Chief, expert When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway Of Battel, open when, and when to close The ridges of grim Warr; no thought of flight, None of retreat, no unbecoming deed That argu\u2019d fear; each on himself reli\u2019d, As onely in his arm the moment lay Of victorie; deeds of eternal fame Were don, but infinite: for wide was spred That Warr and various; somtimes on firm ground A standing fight, then soaring on main wing Tormented all the Air; all Air seemd then Conflicting Fire: long time in eeven scale The Battel hung; till Satan, who that day Prodigious power had shewn, and met in Armes No equal, raunging through the dire attack Of fighting Seraphim confus\u2019d, at length Saw where the Sword of Michael smote, and fell\u2019d Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway Brandisht aloft the horrid edge came down Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand He hasted, and oppos\u2019d the rockie Orb Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield A vast circumference: At his approach The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toile Surceas\u2019d, and glad as hoping here to end Intestine War in Heav\u2019n, the arch foe subdu\u2019d Or Captive drag\u2019d in Chains, with hostile frown And visage all enflam\u2019d first thus began. Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt, Unnam\u2019d in Heav\u2019n, now plenteous, as thou seest These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all, Though heaviest by just measure on thy self And thy adherents: how hast thou disturb\u2019d Heav\u2019ns blessed peace, and into Nature brought Miserie, uncreated till the crime Of thy Rebellion? how hast thou instill\u2019d Thy malice into thousands, once upright And faithful, now prov\u2019d false. But think not here To trouble Holy Rest; Heav\u2019n casts thee out From all her Confines. Heav\u2019n the seat of bliss Brooks not the works of violence and Warr. Hence then, and evil go with thee along Thy ofspring, to the place of evil, Hell, Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles, Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doome, Or som more sudden vengeance wing\u2019d from God Precipitate thee with augmented paine. So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus The Adversarie. Nor think thou with wind Of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds Thou canst not. Hast thou turnd the least of these To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise Unvanquisht, easier to transact with mee That thou shouldst hope, imperious, & with threats To chase me hence? erre not that so shall end The strife which thou call\u2019st evil, but wee style The strife of Glorie: which we mean to win, Or turn this Heav\u2019n it self into the Hell Thou fablest, here however to dwell free, If not to reign: mean while thy utmost force, And join him nam\u2019d Almightie to thy aid, I flie not, but have sought thee farr and nigh.", "They ended parle, and both addrest for fight Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue Of Angels, can relate, or to what things Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift Human imagination to such highth Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemd, Stood they or mov\u2019d, in stature, motion, arms Fit to decide the Empire of great Heav\u2019n. Now wav\u2019d thir fierie Swords, and in the Aire Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns thir Shields Blaz\u2019d opposite, while expectation stood In horror; from each hand with speed retir\u2019d Where erst was thickest fight, th\u2019 Angelic throng, And left large field, unsafe within the wind Of such commotion, such as to set forth Great things by small, If Natures concord broke, Among the Constellations warr were sprung, Two Planets rushing from aspect maligne Of fiercest opposition in mid Skie, Should combat, and thir jarring Sphears confound. Together both with next to Almightie Arme, Uplifted imminent one stroke they aim\u2019d That might determine, and not need repeate, As not of power, at once; nor odds appeerd In might or swift prevention; but the sword Of Michael from the Armorie of God Was giv\u2019n him temperd so, that neither keen Nor solid might resist that edge: it met The sword of Satan with steep force to smite Descending, and in half cut sheere, nor staid, But with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shar\u2019d All his right side; then Satan first knew pain, And writh\u2019d him to and fro convolv\u2019d; so sore The griding sword with discontinuous wound Pass\u2019d through him, but th\u2019 Ethereal substance clos\u2019d Not long divisible, and from the gash A stream of Nectarous humor issuing flow\u2019d Sanguin, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed, And all his Armour staind ere while so bright. Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run By Angels many and strong, who interpos\u2019d Defence, while others bore him on thir Shields Back to his Chariot; where it stood retir\u2019d From off the files of warr; there they him laid Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame To find himself not matchless, and his pride Humbl\u2019d by such rebuke, so farr beneath His confidence to equal God in power. Yet soon he heal\u2019d; for Spirits that live throughout Vital in every part, not as frail man In Entrailes, Heart or Head, Liver or Reines, Cannot but by annihilating die; Nor in thir liquid texture mortal wound Receive, no more then can the fluid Aire: All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Eare, All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please, They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare. Mean while in other parts like deeds deservd Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought, And with fierce Ensignes pierc\u2019d the deep array Of Moloc furious King, who him defi\u2019d, And at his Chariot wheeles to drag him bound Threatn\u2019d, nor from the Holie One of Heav\u2019n Refrein\u2019d his tongue blasphemous; but anon Down clov\u2019n to the", "waste, with shatterd Armes And uncouth paine fled bellowing. On each wing Uriel and Raphael his vaunting foe, Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armd, Vanquish\u2019d Adramelec, and Asmadai, Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods Disdain\u2019d, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight, Mangl\u2019d with gastly wounds through Plate and Maile. Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy The Atheist crew, but with redoubl\u2019d blow Ariel and Arioc, and the violence Of Ramiel scorcht and blasted overthrew. I might relate of thousands, and thir names Eternize here on Earth; but those elect Angels contented with thir fame in Heav\u2019n Seek not the praise of men: the other sort In might though wondrous and in Acts of Warr, Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doome Canceld from Heav\u2019n and sacred memorie, Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell. For strength from Truth divided and from Just, Illaudable, naught merits but dispraise And ignominie, yet to glorie aspires Vain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame: Therfore Eternal silence be thir doome. And now thir mightiest quelld, the battel swerv\u2019d, With many an inrode gor\u2019d; deformed rout Enter\u2019d, and foul disorder; all the ground With shiverd armour strow\u2019n, and on a heap Chariot and Charioter lay overturnd And fierie foaming Steeds; what stood, recoyld Orewearied, through the faint Satanic Host Defensive scarse, or with pale fear surpris\u2019d, Then first with fear surpris\u2019d and sense of paine Fled ignominious, to such evil brought By sinne of disobedience, till that hour Not liable to fear or flight or paine. Far otherwise th\u2019 inviolable Saints In Cubic Phalanx firm advanc\u2019t entire, Invulnerable, impenitrably arm\u2019d: Such high advantages thir innocence Gave them above thir foes, not to have sinnd, Not to have disobei\u2019d; in fight they stood Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pain\u2019d By wound, though from thir place by violence mov\u2019d. Now Night her course began, and over Heav\u2019n Inducing darkness, grateful truce impos\u2019d, And silence on the odious dinn of Warr: Under her Cloudie covert both retir\u2019d, Victor and Vanquisht: on the foughten field Michael and his Angels prevalent Encamping, plac\u2019d in Guard thir Watches round, Cherubic waving fires: on th\u2019 other part Satan with his rebellious disappeerd, Far in the dark dislodg\u2019d, and void of rest, His Potentates to Councel call\u2019d by night; And in the midst thus undismai\u2019d began. O now in danger tri\u2019d, now known in Armes Not to be overpowerd, Companions deare, Found worthy not of Libertie alone, Too mean pretense, but what we more affect, Honour, Dominion, Glorie, and renowne, Who have sustaind one day in doubtful fight, (And if one day, why not Eternal dayes?) What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send Against us from about his Throne, and judg\u2019d Sufficient to subdue us to his will, But proves not so: then fallible, it seems, Of future we may deem him, though till now Omniscient thought. True is, less firmly arm\u2019d, Some disadvantage we endur\u2019d and paine, Till now not known, but known as soon", "contemnd, Since now we find this our Empyreal forme Incapable of mortal injurie Imperishable, and though peirc\u2019d with wound, Soon closing, and by native vigour heal\u2019d. Of evil then so small as easie think The remedie; perhaps more valid Armes, Weapons more violent, when next we meet, May serve to better us, and worse our foes, Or equal what between us made the odds, In Nature none: if other hidden cause Left them Superiour, while we can preserve Unhurt our mindes, and understanding sound, Due search and consultation will disclose. He sat; and in th\u2019 assembly next upstood Nisroc, of Principalities the prime; As one he stood escap\u2019t from cruel fight, Sore toild, his riv\u2019n Armes to havoc hewn, And cloudie in aspect thus answering spake. Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard For Gods, and too unequal work we find Against unequal armes to fight in paine, Against unpaind, impassive; from which evil Ruin must needs ensue; for what availes Valour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands Of Mightiest. Sense of pleasure we may well Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine, But live content, which is the calmest life: But pain is perfet miserie, the worst Of evils, and excessive, overturnes All patience. He who therefore can invent With what more forcible we may offend Our yet unwounded Enemies, or arme Our selves with like defence, to mee deserves No less then for deliverance what we owe. Whereto with look compos\u2019d Satan repli\u2019d. Not uninvented that, which thou aright Beleivst so main to our success, I bring; Which of us who beholds the bright surface Of this Ethereous mould whereon we stand, This continent of spacious Heav\u2019n, adornd With Plant, Fruit, Flour Ambrosial, Gemms & Gold, Whose Eye so superficially surveyes These things, as not to mind from whence they grow Deep under ground, materials dark and crude, Of spiritous and fierie spume, till toucht With Heav\u2019ns ray, and temperd they shoot forth So beauteous, op\u2019ning to the ambient light. These in thir dark Nativitie the Deep Shall yeild us, pregnant with infernal flame, Which into hallow Engins long and round Thick- rammd, at th\u2019 other bore with touch of fire Dilated and infuriate shall send forth From far with thundring noise among our foes Such implements of mischief as shall dash To pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt. Nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne, Effect shall end our wish. Mean while revive; Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joind Think nothing hard, much less to be despaird. He ended, and his words thir drooping chere Enlightn\u2019d, and thir languisht hope reviv\u2019d. Th\u2019 invention all admir\u2019d, and each, how hee To be th\u2019 inventer miss\u2019d, so easie it seemd Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought Impossible: yet haply of thy", "Race In future dayes, if Malice should abound, Some one intent on mischief, or inspir\u2019d With dev\u2019lish machination might devise Like instrument to plague the Sons of men For sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent. Forthwith from Councel to the work they flew, None arguing stood, innumerable hands Were ready, in a moment up they turnd Wide the Celestial soile, and saw beneath Th\u2019 originals of Nature in thir crude Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame They found, they mingl\u2019d, and with suttle Art, Concocted and adusted they reduc\u2019d To blackest grain, and into store conveyd: Part hidd\u2019n veins diggd up (nor hath this Earth Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone, Whereof to found thir Engins and thir Balls Of missive ruin; part incentive reed Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire. So all ere day spring, under conscious Night Secret they finish\u2019d, and in order set, With silent circumspection unespi\u2019d. Now when fair Morn Orient in Heav\u2019n appeerd Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood Of Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host, Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills Lookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure, Each quarter, to descrie the distant foe, Where lodg\u2019d, or whither fled, or if for fight, In motion or in alt: him soon they met Under spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail Zephiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing, Came flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus cri\u2019d. Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand, Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud He comes, and settl\u2019d in his face I see Sad resolution and secure: let each His Adamantine coat gird well, and each Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield, Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down, If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr, But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire. So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon In order, quit of all impediment; Instant without disturb they took Allarm, And onward move Embattelld; when behold Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube Training his devilish Enginrie, impal\u2019d On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep, To hide the fraud. At interview both stood A while, but suddenly at head appeerd Satan: And thus was heard Commanding loud. Vangard, to Right and Left the Front unfould; That all may see who hate us, how we seek Peace and composure, and with open brest Stand readie to receive them, if they like Our overture, and turn not back perverse; But that I doubt, however witness Heaven, Heav\u2019n witness thou anon, while we discharge Freely our part: yee who appointed stand Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch What we propound, and loud that all may hear. So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce Had ended; when to Right and", "Left the Front Divided, and to either Flank retir\u2019d. Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange, A triple-mounted row of Pillars laid On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem\u2019d Or hollow\u2019d bodies made of Oak or Firr With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell\u2019d) Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes With hideous orifice gap\u2019t on us wide, Portending hollow truce; at each behind A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense, Collected stood within our thoughts amus\u2019d, Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds Put forth, and to a narrow vent appli\u2019d With nicest touch. Immediate in a flame, But soon obscur\u2019d with smoak, all Heav\u2019n appeerd, From those deep-throated Engins belcht, whose roar Emboweld with outragious noise the Air, And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule Thir devillish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host Level\u2019d, with such impetuous furie smote, That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand, Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl\u2019d; The sooner for thir Arms, unarm\u2019d they might Have easily as Spirits evaded swift By quick contraction or remove; but now Foule dissipation follow\u2019d and forc\u2019t rout; Nor serv\u2019d it to relax thir serried files. What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse Repeated, and indecent overthrow Doubl\u2019d, would render them yet more despis\u2019d, And to thir foes a laughter; for in view Stood rankt of Seraphim another row In posture to displode thir second tire Of Thunder: back defeated to return They worse abhorr\u2019d. Satan beheld thir plight, And to his Mates thus in derision call\u2019d. O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud? Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee, To entertain them fair with open Front And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms Of composition, strait they chang\u2019d thir minds, Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell, As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose If our proposals once again were heard We should compel them to a quick result. To whom thus Belial in like gamesom mood. Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight, Of hard contents, and full of force urg\u2019d home, Such as we might perceive amus\u2019d them all, And stumbl\u2019d many, who receives them right, Had need from head to foot well understand; Not understood, this gift they have besides, They shew us when our foes walk not upright. So they among themselves in pleasant veine Stood scoffing, highthn\u2019d in thir thoughts beyond All doubt of Victorie, eternal might To match with thir inventions they presum\u2019d So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn, And all his Host derided, while they stood A while in trouble; but they stood not long, Rage prompted them at length, & found them arms", "Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose. Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac\u2019d) Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills (For Earth hath this variety from Heav\u2019n Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale) Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew, From thir foundations loosning to and fro They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load, Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze, Be sure, and terrour seis\u2019d the rebel Host, When coming towards them so dread they saw The bottom of the Mountains upward turn\u2019d, Till on those cursed Engins triple-row They saw them whelmd, and all thir confidence Under the weight of Mountains buried deep, Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads Main Promontories flung, which in the Air Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm\u2019d, Thir armor help\u2019d thir harm, crush\u2019t in and brus\u2019d Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain Implacable, and many a dolorous groan, Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light, Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown. The rest in imitation to like Armes Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore; So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills Hurl\u2019d to and fro with jaculation dire, That under ground they fought in dismal shade; Infernal noise; Warr seem\u2019d a civil Game To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav\u2019n Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspred, Had not th\u2019 Almightie Father where he sits Shrin\u2019d in his Sanctuarie of Heav\u2019n secure, Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen This tumult, and permitted all, advis\u2019d: That his great purpose he might so fulfill, To honour his Anointed Son aveng\u2019d Upon his enemies, and to declare All power on him transferr\u2019d: whence to his Son Th\u2019 Assessor of his Throne he thus began. Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov\u2019d, Son in whose face invisible is beheld Visibly, what by Deitie I am, And in whose hand what by Decree I doe, Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past, Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav\u2019n, Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight, As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm\u2019d; For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst, Equal in their Creation they were form\u2019d, Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom; Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last Endless, and no solution will be found: Warr wearied hath perform\u2019d what Warr can do, And to disorder\u2019d rage let loose the reines, With Mountains as with Weapons arm\u2019d, which makes Wild work in Heav\u2019n, and dangerous to the maine. Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine; For thee I have ordain\u2019d it, and thus farr Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine Of ending", "this great Warr, since none but Thou Can end it. Into thee such Vertue and Grace Immense I have transfus\u2019d, that all may know In Heav\u2019n and Hell thy Power above compare, And this perverse Commotion governd thus, To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir Of all things, to be Heir and to be King By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right. Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might, Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles That shake Heav\u2019ns basis, bring forth all my Warr, My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh; Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out From all Heav\u2019ns bounds into the utter Deep: There let them learn, as likes them, to despise God and Messiah his anointed King. He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct Shon full, he all his Father full exprest Ineffably into his face receiv\u2019d, And thus the filial Godhead answering spake. O Father, O Supream of heav\u2019nly Thrones, First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee, As is most just; this I my Glorie account, My exaltation, and my whole delight, That thou in me well pleas\u2019d, declarst thy will Fulfill\u2019d, which to fulfil is all my bliss. Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume, And gladlier shall resign, when in the end Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov\u2019st: But whom thou hat\u2019st, I hate, and can put on Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on, Image of thee in all things; and shall soon, Armd with thy might, rid heav\u2019n of these rebell\u2019d, To thir prepar\u2019d ill Mansion driven down To chains of Darkness, and th\u2019 undying Worm, That from thy just obedience could revolt, Whom to obey is happiness entire. Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th\u2019 impure Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount Unfained Halleluiahs to thee sing, Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief. So said, he o\u2019re his Scepter bowing, rose From the right hand of Glorie where he sate, And the third sacred Morn began to shine Dawning through Heav\u2019n: forth rush\u2019d with whirlwind sound The Chariot of Paternal Deitie, Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn, It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the Wheels Of Beril, and careering Fires between; Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament, Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch. Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought, Ascended, at his right hand Victorie Sate Eagle-wing\u2019d, beside him hung his Bow And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor\u2019d, And from about him fierce Effusion rowld Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire; Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints, He onward came, farr off", "his coming shon, And twentie thousand (I thir number heard) Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen: Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime On the Crystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron\u2019d. Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz\u2019d, When the great Ensign of Messiah blaz\u2019d Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav\u2019n: Under whose Conduct Michael soon reduc\u2019d His Armie, circumfus\u2019d on either Wing, Under thir Head imbodied all in one. Before him Power Divine his way prepar\u2019d; At his command the uprooted Hills retir\u2019d Each to his place, they heard his voice and went Obsequious, Heav\u2019n his wonted face renewd, And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil\u2019d. This saw his hapless Foes, but stood obdur\u2019d, And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers Insensate, hope conceiving from despair. In heav\u2019nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell? But to convince the proud what Signs availe, Or Wonders move th\u2019 obdurate to relent? They hard\u2019nd more by what might most reclame, Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight Took envie, and aspiring to his highth, Stood reimbattell\u2019d fierce, by force or fraud Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile Against God and Messiah, or to fall In universal ruin last, and now To final Battel drew, disdaining flight, Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God To all his Host on either hand thus spake. Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand Ye Angels arm\u2019d, this day from Battel rest; Faithful hath been your Warfare, and of God Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause, And as ye have receivd, so have ye don Invincibly; but of this cursed crew The punishment to other hand belongs, Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints; Number to this dayes work is not ordain\u2019d Nor multitude, stand onely and behold Gods indignation on these Godless pourd By mee; not you but mee they have despis\u2019d, Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage, Because the Father, t\u2019 whom in Heav\u2019n supream Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains, Hath honourd me according to his will. Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig\u2019n\u2019d; That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee In Battel which the stronger proves, they all, Or I alone against them, since by strength They measure all, of other excellence Not emulous, nor care who them excells; Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe. So spake the Son, and into terrour chang\u2019d His count\u2019nance too severe to be beheld And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies. At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host. Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove, Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout, All but the Throne it self of God. Full soon Among them he arriv\u2019d; in", "his right hand Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent Before him, such as in thir Soules infix\u2019d Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost, All courage; down thir idle weapons drop\u2019d; O\u2019re Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, That wish\u2019d the Mountains now might be again Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire. Nor less on either side tempestuous fell His arrows, from the fourfold-visag\u2019d Foure, Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels, Distinct alike with multitude of eyes, One Spirit in them rul\u2019d, and every eye Glar\u2019d lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire Among th\u2019 accurst, that witherd all thir strength, And of thir wonted vigour left them draind, Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall\u2019n. Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check\u2019d His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav\u2019n: The overthrown he rais\u2019d, and as a Heard Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu\u2019d With terrors and with furies to the bounds And Chrystall wall of Heav\u2019n, which op\u2019ning wide, Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos\u2019d Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight Strook them with horror backward, but far worse Urg\u2019d them behind; headlong themselvs they threw Down from the verge of Heav\u2019n, Eternal wrauth Burnt after them to the bottomless pit. Hell heard th\u2019 unsufferable noise, Hell saw Heav\u2019n ruining from Heav\u2019n and would have fled Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound. Nine dayes they fell; confounded Chaos roard, And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last Yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos\u2019d, Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine. Disburd\u2019nd Heav\u2019n rejoic\u2019d, and soon repaird Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld. Sole Victor from th\u2019 expulsion of his Foes Messiah his triumphal Chariot turnd: To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts, With Jubilie advanc\u2019d; and as they went, Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright, Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King, Son, Heire, and Lord, to him Dominion giv\u2019n, Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode Triumphant through mid Heav\u2019n, into the Courts And Temple of his mightie Father Thron\u2019d On high; who into Glorie him receav\u2019d, Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss. Thus measuring things in Heav\u2019n by things on Earth At thy request, and that thou maist beware By what is past, to thee I have reveal\u2019d What might have else to human Race bin hid; The discord which befel, and Warr in Heav\u2019n Among th\u2019 Angelic Powers, and the deep fall Of those too high aspiring, who rebelld With Satan, hee who envies now thy state, Who now is plotting how he may seduce Thee also from obedience,", "that with him Bereavd of happiness thou maist partake His punishment, Eternal miserie; Which would be all his solace and revenge, As a despite don against the most High, Thee once to gaine Companion of his woe. But list\u2019n not to his Temptations, warne Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard By terrible Example the reward Of disobedience; firm they might have stood, Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress. THE END OF THE SIXTH BOOK. PARADISE LOST. BOOK VII. Descend from Heav\u2019n Urania, by that name If rightly thou art call\u2019d, whose Voice divine Following, above th\u2019 Olympian Hill I soare, Above the flight of Pegasean wing. The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top Of old Olympus dwell\u2019st, but Heav\u2019nlie borne, Before the Hills appeerd, or Fountain flow\u2019d, Thou with Eternal wisdom didst converse, Wisdom thy Sister, and with her didst play In presence of th\u2019 Almightie Father, pleas\u2019d With thy Celestial Song. Up led by thee Into the Heav\u2019n of Heav\u2019ns I have presum\u2019d, An Earthlie Guest, and drawn Empyreal Aire, Thy tempring; with like safetie guided down Return me to my Native Element: Least from this flying Steed unrein\u2019d, (as once Bellerophon, though from a lower Clime) Dismounted, on th\u2019 Aleian Field I fall Erroneous, there to wander and forlorne. Half yet remaines unsung, but narrower bound Within the visible Diurnal Spheare; Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole, More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchang\u2019d To hoarce or mute, though fall\u2019n on evil dayes, On evil dayes though fall\u2019n, and evil tongues; In darkness, and with dangers compast rouud, And solitude; yet not alone, while thou Visit\u2019st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn Purples the East: still govern thou my Song, Urania, and fit audience find, though few. But drive farr off the barbarous dissonance Of Bacchus and his Revellers, the Race Of that wilde Rout that tore the Thracian Bard In Rhodope, where Woods and Rocks had Eares To rapture, till the savage clamor dround Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend Her Son. So fail not thou, who thee implores: For thou art Heav\u2019nlie, shee an empty dreame. Say Goddess, what ensu\u2019d when Raphael, The affable Arch-angel, had forewarn\u2019d Adam by dire example to beware Apostasie, by what befell in Heaven To those Apostates, least the like befall In Paradise to Adam or his Race, Charg\u2019d not to touch the interdicted Tree, If they transgress, and slight that sole command, So easily obeyd amid the choice Of all tasts else to please thir appetite, Though wandring. He with his consorted Eve The storie heard attentive, and was fill\u2019d With admiration, and deep Muse to heare Of things so high and strange, things to thir thought So unimaginable as hate in Heav\u2019n, And Warr so neer the Peace of God in bliss With such confusion: but the evil soon Driv\u2019n back redounded as a flood on those From", "whom it sprung, impossible to mix With Blessedness. Whence Adam soon repeal\u2019d The doubts that in his heart arose: and now Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know What neerer might concern him, how this World Of Heav\u2019n and Earth conspicuous first began, When, and whereof created, for what cause, What within Eden or without was done Before his memorie, as one whose drouth Yet scarce allay\u2019d still eyes the current streame, Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites, Proceeded thus to ask his Heav\u2019nly Guest. Great things, and full of wonder in our eares, Farr differing from this World, thou hast reveal\u2019d Divine Interpreter, by favour sent Down from the Empyrean to forewarne Us timely of what might else have bin our loss, Unknown, which human knowledg could not reach: For which to the infinitly Good we owe Immortal thanks, and his admonishment Receave with solemne purpose to observe Immutably his sovran will, the end Of what we are. But since thou hast voutsaf\u2019t Gently for our instruction to impart Things above Earthly thought, which yet concernd Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd, Deign to descend now lower, and relate What may no less perhaps availe us known, How first began this Heav\u2019n which we behold Distant so high, with moving Fires adornd Innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills All space, the ambient Aire wide interfus\u2019d Imbracing round this florid Earth, what cause Mov\u2019d the Creator in his holy Rest Through all Eternitie so late to build In Chaos, and the work begun, how soon Absolv\u2019d, if unforbid thou maist unfould What wee, not to explore the secrets aske Of his Eternal Empire, but the more To magnifie his works, the more we know. And the great Light of Day yet wants to run Much of his Race though steep, suspens in Heav\u2019n Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares, And longer will delay to heare thee tell His Generation, and the rising Birth Of Nature from the unapparent Deep: Or if the Starr of Eevning and the Moon Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring Silence, and Sleep listning to thee will watch, Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine. Thus Adam his illustrous Guest besought: And thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde. This also thy request with caution askt Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice, Or heart of man suffice to comprehend? Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve To glorifie the Maker, and inferr Thee also happier, shall not be withheld Thy hearing, such Commission from above I have receav\u2019d, to answer thy desire Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope Things not reveal\u2019d, which th\u2019 invisible King, Onely Omniscient, hath supprest in Night, To none communicable in Earth or Heaven: Anough is left besides to search and know. But Knowledge is", "as food, and needs no less Her Temperance over Appetite, to know In measure what the mind may well contain, Oppresses else with Surfet, and soon turns Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Winde. Know then, that after Lucifer from Heav\u2019n (So call him, brighter once amidst the Host Of Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among) Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep Into his place, and the great Son returnd Victorious with his Saints, th\u2019 Omnipotent Eternal Father from his Throne beheld Thir multitude, and to his Son thus spake. At least our envious Foe hath fail\u2019d, who thought All like himself rebellious, by whose aid This inaccessible high strength, the seat Of Deitie supream, us dispossest, He trusted to have seis\u2019d, and into fraud Drew many, whom thir place knows here no more; Yet farr the greater part have kept, I see, Thir station, Heav\u2019n yet populous retaines Number sufficient to possess her Realmes Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent With Ministeries due and solemn Rites: But least his heart exalt him in the harme Already done, to have dispeopl\u2019d Heav\u2019n, My damage fondly deem\u2019d, I can repaire That detriment, if such it be to lose Self-lost, and in a moment will create Another World, out of one man a Race Of men innumerable, there to dwell, Not here, till by degrees of merit rais\u2019d They open to themselves at length the way Up hither, under long obedience tri\u2019d, And Earth be chang\u2019d to Heavn, & Heav\u2019n to Earth, One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end. Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav\u2019n, And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee This I perform, speak thou, and be it don: My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep Within appointed bounds be Heav\u2019n and Earth, Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill Infinitude, nor vacuous the space. Though I uncircumscrib\u2019d my self retire, And put not forth my goodness, which is free To act or not, Necessitie and Chance Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate. So spake th\u2019 Almightie, and to what he spake His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect. Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift Then time or motion, but to human ears Cannot without process of speech be told, So told as earthly notion can receave. Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav\u2019n When such was heard declar\u2019d the Almightie\u2019s will; Glorie they sung to the most High, good will To future men, and in thir dwellings peace: Glorie to him whose just avenging ire Had driven out th\u2019 ungodly from his sight And th\u2019 habitations of the just; to him Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain\u2019d Good out of evil to create, in stead Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse His good to Worlds and Ages infinite. So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son", "On his great Expedition now appeer\u2019d, Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown\u2019d Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love Immense, and all his Father in him shon. About his Chariot numberless were pour\u2019d Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones, And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing\u2019d, From the Armoury of God, where stand of old Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg\u2019d Against a solemn day, harnest at hand, Celestial Equipage; and now came forth Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd, Attendant on thir Lord: Heav\u2019n op\u2019nd wide Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound On golden Hinges moving, to let forth The King of Glorie in his powerful Word And Spirit coming to create new Worlds. On heav\u2019nly ground they stood, and from the shore They view\u2019d the vast immeasurable Abyss Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde, Up from the bottom turn\u2019d by furious windes And surging waves, as Mountains to assault Heav\u2019ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole. Silence, ye troubl\u2019d waves, and thou Deep, peace, Said then th\u2019 Omnific Word, your discord end: Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode Farr into Chaos, and the World unborn; For Chaos heard his voice: him all his Traine Follow\u2019d in bright procession to behold Creation, and the wonders of his might. Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand He took the golden Compasses, prepar\u2019d In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe This Universe, and all created things: One foot he center\u2019d, and the other turn\u2019d Round through the vast profunditie obscure, And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds, This be thy just Circumference, O World. Thus God the Heav\u2019n created, thus the Earth, Matter unform\u2019d and void: Darkness profound Cover\u2019d th\u2019 Abyss: but on the watrie calme His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred, And vital vertue infus\u2019d, and vital warmth Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg\u2019d The black tartareous cold infernal dregs Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob\u2019d Like things to like, the rest to several place Disparted, and between spun out the Air, And Earth self-ballanc\u2019t on her Center hung. Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East To journie through the airie gloom began, Sphear\u2019d in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle Sojourn\u2019d the while. God saw the Light was good; And light from darkness by the Hemisphere Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night He nam\u2019d. Thus was the first Day Eev\u2019n and Morn: Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld; Birth-day of Heav\u2019n and Earth; with joy and shout The hollow Universal Orb they fill\u2019d, And touch\u2019t thir Golden Harps, & hymning prais\u2019d God and his works, Creatour him they sung, Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn. Again, God said, let ther be Firmament", "Amid the Waters, and let it divide The Waters from the Waters: and God made The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus\u2019d In circuit to the uttermost convex Of this great Round: partition firm and sure, The Waters underneath from those above Dividing: for as Earth, so hee the World Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule Of Chaos farr remov\u2019d, least fierce extreames Contiguous might distemper the whole frame: And Heav\u2019n he nam\u2019d the Firmament: So Eev\u2019n And Morning Chorus sung the second Day. The Earth was form\u2019d, but in the Womb as yet Of Waters, Embryon immature involv\u2019d, Appeer\u2019d not: over all the face of Earth Main Ocean flow\u2019d, not idle, but with warme Prolific humour soft\u2019ning all her Globe, Fermented the great Mother to conceave, Satiate with genial moisture, when God said Be gather\u2019d now ye Waters under Heav\u2019n Into one place, and let dry Land appeer. Immediately the Mountains huge appeer Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie: So high as heav\u2019d the tumid Hills, so low Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep, Capacious bed of Waters: thither they Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld As drops on dust conglobing from the drie; Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct, For haste; such flight the great command impress\u2019d On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard) Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng, Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found, If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine, Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill, But they, or under ground, or circuit wide With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way, And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore; Easie, e\u2019re God had bid the ground be drie, All but within those banks, where Rivers now Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine. The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle Of congregated Waters he call\u2019d Seas: And saw that it was good, and said, Let th\u2019 Earth Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yeilding Seed, And Fruit Tree yeilding Fruit after her kind; Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth. He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn\u2019d, Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad Her Universal Face with pleasant green, Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour\u2019d Op\u2019ning thir various colours, and made gay Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown, Forth flourish\u2019t thick the clustring Vine, forth crept The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed Embattell\u2019d in her field: add the humble Shrub, And Bush with frizl\u2019d hair implicit: last Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm\u2019d Thir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd, With tufts the vallies & each fountain side, With borders long the Rivers. That Earth", "now Seemd like to Heav\u2019n, a seat where Gods might dwell, Or wander with delight, and love to haunt Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain\u2019d Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist Went up and waterd all the ground, and each Plant of the field, which e\u2019re it was in the Earth God made, and every Herb, before it grew On the green stemm; God saw that it was good: So Eev\u2019n and Morn recorded the Third Day. Again th\u2019 Almightie spake: Let there be Lights High in th\u2019 expanse of Heaven to divide The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes, For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years, And let them be for Lights as I ordaine Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav\u2019n To give Light on the Earth; and it was so. And God made two great Lights, great for thir use To Man, the greater to have rule by Day, The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs, And set them in the Firmament of Heav\u2019n To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night, And Light from Darkness to divide. God saw, Surveying his great Work, that it was good: For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun A mightie Spheare he fram\u2019d, unlightsom first, Though of Ethereal Mould: then form\u2019d the Moon Globose, and everie magnitude of Starrs, And sowd with Starrs the Heav\u2019n thick as a field: Of Light by farr the greater part he took, Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac\u2019d In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine Her gather\u2019d beams, great Palace now of Light. Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs Repairing, in thir gold\u2019n Urns draw Light, And hence the Morning Planet guilds his horns; By tincture or reflection they augment Thir small peculiar, though from human sight So farr remote, with diminution seen. First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen, Regent of Day, and all th\u2019 Horizon round Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run His Longitude through Heav\u2019ns high rode: the gray Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danc\u2019d Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon, But opposite in leveld West was set His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light From him, for other light she needed none In that aspect, and still that distance keepes Till night, then in the East her turn she shines, Revolvd on Heav\u2019ns great Axle, and her Reign With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds, With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer\u2019d Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose, Glad Eevning & glad Morn crownd the fourth day. And God said, let the Waters generate Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule: And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings Displayd on the op\u2019n Firmament of Heav\u2019n. And God", "created the great Whales, and each Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously The waters generated by thir kindes, And every Bird of wing after his kinde; And saw that it was good, and bless\u2019d them, saying, Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill; And let the Fowle be multiply\u2019d on the Earth. Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek & Bay With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales Of Fish that with thir Finns and shining Scales Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, & through Groves Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance Show to the Sun thir wav\u2019d coats dropt with Gold, Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale, And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes, And seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles Draws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea. Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares Thir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclos\u2019d Thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge They summ\u2019d thir Penns, and soaring th\u2019 air sublime With clang despis\u2019d the ground, under a cloud In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build: Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise In common, rang\u2019d in figure wedge thir way, Intelligent of seasons, and set forth Thir Aierie Caravan high over Sea\u2019s Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane Her annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire Floats, as they pass, fann\u2019d with unnumber\u2019d plumes: From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song Solac\u2019d the Woods, and spred thir painted wings Till Ev\u2019n, nor then the solemn Nightingal Ceas\u2019d warbling, but all night tun\u2019d her soft layes: Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath\u2019d Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground Walk\u2019d firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds The silent hours, and th\u2019 other whose gay Traine Adorns him, colour\u2019d with the Florid hue Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes. The Waters thus With Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle, Ev\u2019ning and Morn solemniz\u2019d the Fift day. The Sixt, and of Creation last arose With Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said, Let th\u2019 Earth bring forth Fowle living in her kinde, Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth, Each in their kinde. The Earth obey\u2019d, and strait Op\u2019ning", "her fertil Woomb teem\u2019d at a Birth Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes, Limb\u2019d and full grown: out of the ground up-rose As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den; Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk\u2019d: The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green: Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung: The grassie Clods now Calv\u2019d, now half appeer\u2019d The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds, And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce, The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale Rising, the crumbl\u2019d Earth above them threw In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould Behemoth biggest born of Earth upheav\u2019d His vastness: Fleec\u2019t the Flocks and bleating rose, As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land The River Horse and scalie Crocodile. At once came forth whatever creeps the ground, Insect or Worme; those wav\u2019d thir limber fans For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green: These as a line thir long dimension drew, Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde Wondrous in length and corpulence involv\u2019d Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings. First crept The Parsimonious Emmet, provident Of future, in small room large heart enclos\u2019d, Pattern of just equalitie perhaps Hereafter, join\u2019d in her popular Tribes Of Commonaltie: swarming next appeer\u2019d The Femal Bee that feeds her Husband Drone Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells With Honey stor\u2019d: the rest are numberless, And thou thir Natures know\u2019st, and gav\u2019st them Names, Needlest to thee repeaed; nor unknown The Serpent suttl\u2019st Beast of all the field, Of huge extent somtimes, with brazen Eyes And hairie Main terrific, though to thee Not noxious, but obedient at thy call. Now Heav\u2019n in all her Glorie shon, and rowld Her motions, as the great first-Movers hand First wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire Consummate lovly smil\u2019d; Aire, Water, Earth, By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt Frequent; and of the Sixt day yet remain\u2019d; There wanted yet the Master work, the end Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone And Brute as other Creatures, but endu\u2019d With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect His Stature, and upright with Front serene Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence Magnanimous to correspond with Heav\u2019n, But grateful to acknowledge whence his good Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes Directed in Devotion, to adore And worship God Supream, who made him chief Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent Eternal Father (For where is not hee Present) thus to his Son audibly spake. Let us make now Man in our image, Man In our similitude, and let them rule Over the Fish and Fowle of", "Sea and Aire, Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth, And every creeping thing that creeps the ground. This said, he formd thee, Adam, thee O Man Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath\u2019d The breath of Life; in his own Image hee Created thee, in the Image of God Express, and thou becam\u2019st a living Soul. Male he created thee, but thy consort Femal for Race; then bless\u2019d Mankinde, and said, Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth, Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire, And every living thing that moves on the Earth. Wherever thus created, for no place Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know\u2019st He brought thee into this delicious Grove, This Garden, planted with the Trees of God, Delectable both to behold and taste; And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th\u2019 Earth yeelds, Varietie without end; but of the Tree Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil, Thou mai\u2019st not; in the day thou eat\u2019st, thou di\u2019st; Death is the penaltie impos\u2019d, beware, And govern well thy appetite, least sin Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death. Here finish\u2019d hee, and all that he had made View\u2019d, and behold all was entirely good; So Ev\u2019n and Morn accomplish\u2019d the Sixt day: Yet not till the Creator from his work Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd Up to the Heav\u2019n of Heav\u2019ns his high abode, Thence to behold this new created World Th\u2019 addition of his Empire, how it shew\u2019d In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire, Answering his great Idea. Up he rode Followd with acclamation and the sound Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun\u2019d Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire Resounded, (thou remember\u2019st, for thou heardst) The Heav\u2019ns and all the Constellations rung, The Planets in thir stations list\u2019ning stood, While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant. Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung, Open, ye Heav\u2019ns, your living dores; let in The great Creator from his work returnd Magnificent, his Six days work, a World; Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne To visit oft the dwellings of just Men Delighted, and with frequent intercourse Thither will send his winged Messengers On errands of supernal Grace. So sung The glorious Train ascending: He through Heav\u2019n, That open\u2019d wide her blazing Portals, led To Gods Eternal house direct the way, A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer, Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest Pouderd with Starrs. And now on Earth the Seaventh Eev\u2019ning arose in Eden, for the Sun Was set, and twilight from the East came on, Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount Of Heav\u2019ns high-seated top, th\u2019 Impereal Throne Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure, The Filial Power arriv\u2019d, and sate him down", "With his great Father (for he also went Invisible, yet staid (such priviledge Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordain\u2019d, Author and end of all things, and from work Now resting, bless\u2019d and hallowd the Seav\u2019nth day, As resting on that day from all his work, But not in silence holy kept; the Harp Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe, And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop, All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire Temper\u2019d soft Tunings, intermixt with Voice Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount. Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung, Great are thy works, Jehovah, infinite Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue Relate thee; greater now in thy return Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day Thy Thunders magnifi\u2019d; but to create Is greater then created to destroy. Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw The number of thy worshippers. Who seekes To lessen thee, against his purpose serves To manifest the more thy might: his evil Thou usest, and from thence creat\u2019st more good. Witness this new-made World, another Heav\u2019n From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view On the cleer Hyaline, the Glassie Sea; Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr\u2019s Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World Of destind habitation; but thou know\u2019st Thir seasons: among these the seat of men, Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus\u2019d, Thir pleasant dwelling place. Thrice happie men, And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanc\u2019t, Created in his Image, there to dwell And worship him, and in reward to rule Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air, And multiply a Race of Worshippers Holy and just: thrice happie if they know Thir happiness, and persevere upright. So sung they, and the Empyrean rung, With Halleluiahs: Thus was Sabbath kept. And thy request think now fulfill\u2019d, that ask\u2019d How first this World and face of things began, And what before thy memorie was don From the beginning, that posteritie Informd by thee might know; if else thou seekst Aught, not surpassing human measure, say. To whom thus Adam gratefully repli\u2019d. What thanks sufficient, or what recompence Equal have I to render thee, Divine Hystorian, who thus largely hast allayd The thirst I had of knowledge, and voutsaf\u2019t This friendly condescention to relate Things else by me unsearchable, now heard VVith wonder, but delight, and, as is due, With glorie attributed to the high Creator; some thing yet of doubt remaines, VVhich onely thy solution can resolve. VVhen I behold this goodly Frame, this VVorld Of Heav\u2019n and Earth consisting, and compute, Thir magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a graine, An Atom, with the Firmament compar\u2019d And all her numberd Starrs, that seem to rowle Spaces incomprehensible (for such Thir distance argues and thir", "swift return Diurnal) meerly to officiate light Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot, One day and night; in all thir vast survey Useless besides, reasoning I oft admire, How Nature wise and frugal could commit Such disproportions, with superfluous hand So many nobler Bodies to create, Greater so manifold to this one use, For aught appeers, and on thir Orbs impose Such restless revolution day by day Repeated, while the sedentarie Earth, That better might with farr less compass move, Serv\u2019d by more noble then her self, attaines Her end without least motion, and receaves, As Tribute such a sumless journey brought Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light; Speed, to describe whose swiftness Number failes. So spake our Sire, and by his count\u2019nance seemd Entring on studious thoughts abstruse, which Eve Perceaving where she sat retir\u2019d in sight, With lowliness Majestic from her seat, And Grace that won who saw to wish her stay, Rose, and went forth among her Fruits and Flours, To visit how they prosper\u2019d, bud and bloom, Her Nurserie; they at her coming sprung And toucht by her fair tendance gladlier grew. Yet went she not, as not with such discourse Delighted, or not capable her eare Of what was high: such pleasure she reserv\u2019d, Adam relating, she sole Auditress; Her Husband the Relater she preferr\u2019d Before the Angel, and of him to ask Chose rather; hee, she knew would intermix Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute With conjugal Caresses, from his Lip Not Words alone pleas\u2019d her. O when meet now Such pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joyn\u2019d? With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went; Not unattended, for on her as Queen A pomp of winning Graces waited still, And from about her shot Darts of desire Into all Eyes to wish her still in sight. And Raphael now to Adam\u2019s doubt propos\u2019d Benevolent and facil thus repli\u2019d. To ask or search I blame thee not, for Heav\u2019n Is as the Book of God before thee set, Wherein to read his wondrous Works, and learne His Seasons, Hours, or Days, or Months, or Yeares: This to attain, whether Heav\u2019n move or Earth, Imports not, if thou reck\u2019n right, the rest From Man or Angel the great Architect Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge His secrets to be scann\u2019d by them who ought Rather admire; or if they list to try Conjecture, he his Fabric of the Heav\u2019ns Hath left to thir disputes, perhaps to move His laughter at thir quaint Opinions wide Hereafter, when they come to model Heav\u2019n And calculate the Starrs, how they will weild The mightie frame, how build, unbuild, contrive To save appeerances, how gird the Sphear With Centric and Eccentric scribl\u2019d o\u2019re, Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb: Alreadie by thy reasoning this I guess, Who art to lead thy ofspring, and supposest That Bodies bright and greater should not serve The less not bright, nor Heav\u2019n such journies run, Earth sitting still, when she alone receaves", "The benefit: consider first, that Great Or Bright inferrs not Excellence: the Earth Though, in comparison of Heav\u2019n, so small, Nor glistering, may of solid good containe More plenty then the Sun that barren shines, Whose vertue on it self workes no effect, But in the fruitful Earth; there first receavd His beams, unactive else, thir vigor find. Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries Officious, but to thee Earths habitant. And for the Heav\u2019ns wide Circuit, let it speak The Makers high magnificence, who built So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so farr; That Man may know he dwells not in his own; An Edifice too large for him to fill, Lodg\u2019d in a small partition, and the rest Ordain\u2019d for uses to his Lord best known. The swiftness of those Circles attribute, Though numberless, to his Omnipotence, That to corporeal substances could adde Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow, Who since the Morning hour set out from Heav\u2019n Where God resides, and ere mid-day arriv\u2019d In Eden, distance inexpressible By Numbers that have name. But this I urge, Admitting Motion in the Heav\u2019ns, to shew Invalid that which thee to doubt it mov\u2019d; Not that I so affirm, though so it seem To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth. God to remove his wayes from human sense, Plac\u2019d Heav\u2019n from Earth so farr, that earthly sight, If it presume, might erre in things too high, And no advantage gaine. What if the Sun Be Center to the World, and other Starrs By his attractive vertue and thir own Incited, dance about him various rounds? Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid, Progressive, retrograde, or standing still, In six thou seest, and what if sev\u2019nth to these The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem, Insensibly three different Motions move? Which else to several Sphears thou must ascribe, Mov\u2019d contrarie with thwart obliquities, Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos\u2019d, Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe, If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day Travelling East, and with her part averse From the Suns beam meet Night, her other part Still luminous by his ray. What if that light Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire, To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr Enlightning her by Day, as she by Night This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there, Feilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce Fruits in her soft\u2019nd Soile, for some to eate Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie Communicating Male and Femal Light, Which two great Sexes animate the World, Stor\u2019d in each Orb perhaps with some that live. For such vast room in Nature unpossest By living Soule, desert and desolate, Onely to shine, yet scarce to contribute Each Orb a glimps of", "Light, conveyd so farr Down to this habitable, which returnes Light back to them, is obvious to dispute. But whether thus these things, or whether not, Whether the Sun predominant in Heav\u2019n Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun, Hee from the East his flaming rode begin, Or Shee from West her silent course advance With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps On her soft Axle, while she paces Eev\u2019n, And bears thee soft with the smooth Air along, Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid, Leave them to God above, him serve and feare; Of other Creatures, as him pleases best, Wherever plac\u2019t, let him dispose: joy thou In what he gives to thee, this Paradise And thy faire Eve; Heav\u2019n is for thee too high To know what passes there; be lowlie wise: Think onely what concernes thee and thy being; Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there Live, in what state, condition or degree, Contented that thus farr hath been reveal\u2019d Not of Earth onely but of highest Heav\u2019n. To whom thus Adam cleerd of doubt, repli\u2019d. How fully hast thou satisfi\u2019d mee, pure Intelligence of Heav\u2019n, Angel serene, And freed from intricacies, taught to live, The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares, And not molest us, unless we our selves Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vaine. But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end; Till warn\u2019d, or by experience taught, she learne, That not to know at large of things remote From use, obscure and suttle, but to know That which before us lies in daily life, Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume, Or emptiness, or fond impertinence, And renders us in things that most concerne Unpractis\u2019d, unprepar\u2019d, and still to seek. Therefore from this high pitch let us descend A lower flight, and speak of things at hand Useful, whence haply mention may arise Of somthing not unseasonable to ask By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign\u2019d. Thee I have heard relating what was don Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard; And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest How suttly to detaine thee I devise, Inviting thee to hear while I relate, Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply: For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav\u2019n, And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst And hunger both, from labour, at the houre Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill, Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine Imbu\u2019d, bring to thir sweetness no satietie. To whom thus Raphael answer\u2019d heav\u2019nly meek. Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men, Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee Abundantly his gifts hath also pour\u2019d, Inward and outward both,", "his image faire: Speaking or mute all comliness and grace Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes. Nor less think wee in Heav\u2019n of thee on Earth Then of our fellow servant, and inquire Gladly into the wayes of God with Man: For God we see hath honour\u2019d thee, and set On Man his equal Love: say therefore on; For I that Day was absent, as befell, Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure, Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell; Squar\u2019d in full Legion (such command we had) To see that none thence issu\u2019d forth a spie, Or enemie, while God was in his work, Least hee incenst at such eruption bold, Destruction with Creation might have mixt. Not that they durst without his leave attempt, But us he sends upon his high behests For state, as Sovran King, and to enure Our prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shut The dismal Gates, and barricado\u2019d strong; But long ere our approaching heard within Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song, Torment, and lowd lament, and furious rage. Glad we return\u2019d up to the coasts of Light Ere Sabbath Eev\u2019ning: so we had in charge. But thy relation now; for I attend, Pleas\u2019d with thy words no less then thou with mine. So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire. For Man to tell how human Life began Is hard; for who himself beginning knew? Desire with thee still longer to converse Induc\u2019d me. As new wak\u2019t from soundest sleep Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun Soon dri\u2019d, and on the reaking moisture fed. Strait toward Heav\u2019n my wondring Eyes I turnd, And gaz\u2019d a while the ample Skie, till rais\u2019d By quick instinctive motion up I sprung, As thitherward endevoring, and upright Stood on my feet; about me round I saw Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines, And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these, Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk\u2019d, or flew, Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil\u2019d, With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow\u2019d. My self I then perus\u2019d, and Limb by Limb Survey\u2019d, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran With supple joints, as lively vigour led: But who I was, or where, or from what cause, Knew not; to speak I tri\u2019d, and forthwith spake, My Tongue obey\u2019d and readily could name What e\u2019re I saw. Thou Sun, said I, faire Light, And thou enlight\u2019nd Earth, so fresh and gay, Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines, And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here? Not of my self; by some great Maker then, In goodness and in power praeeminent; Tell me, how may I know him, how adore, From whom I have that thus I move and live, And feel that I am happier then I know. While thus", "I call\u2019d, and stray\u2019d I knew not whither, From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld This happie Light, when answer none return\u2019d, On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep First found me, and with soft oppression seis\u2019d My droused sense, untroubl\u2019d, though I thought I then was passing to my former state Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve: When suddenly stood at my Head a dream, Whose inward apparition gently mov\u2019d My Fancy to believe I yet had being, And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine, And said, thy Mansion wants thee, Adam, rise, First Man, of Men innumerable ordain\u2019d First Father, call\u2019d by thee I come thy Guide To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar\u2019d. So saying, by the hand he took me rais\u2019d, And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire Smooth sliding without step, last led me up A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine, A Circuit wide, enclos\u2019d, with goodliest Trees Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw Of Earth before scarse pleasant seemd. Each Tree Load\u2019n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye Tempting, stirr\u2019d in me sudden appetite To pluck and eate; whereat I wak\u2019d, and found Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide Up hither, from among the Trees appeer\u2019d, Presence Divine. Rejoycing, but with aw In adoration at his feet I fell Submiss: he rear\u2019d me, & Whom thou soughtst I am, Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest Above, or round about thee or beneath. This Paradise I give thee, count it thine To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate: Of every Tree that in the Garden growes Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth: But of the Tree whose operation brings Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith, Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life, Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste, And shun the bitter consequence: for know, The day thou eat\u2019st thereof, my sole command Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye; From that day mortal, and this happie State Shalt loose, expell\u2019d from hence into a World Of woe and sorrow. Sternly he pronounc\u2019d The rigid interdiction, which resounds Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect Return\u2019d and gratious purpose thus renew\u2019d. Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords Possess it, and all things that therein live, Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle. In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold After thir kindes; I bring them to receave From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie With low subjection; understand the same Of Fish within thir watry residence, Not hither summond,", "since they cannot change Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire. As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold Approaching two and two, These cowring low With blandishment, each Bird stoop\u2019d on his wing. I nam\u2019d them, as they pass\u2019d, and understood Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu\u2019d My sudden apprehension: but in these I found not what me thought I wanted still; And to the Heav\u2019nly vision thus presum\u2019d. O by what Name, for thou above all these, Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher, Surpassest farr my naming, how may I Adore thee, Author of this Universe, And all this good to man, for whose well being So amply, and with hands so liberal Thou hast provided all things: but with mee I see not who partakes. In solitude What happiness, who can enjoy alone, Or all enjoying, what contentment find? Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright, As with a smile more bright\u2019nd, thus repli\u2019d. What call\u2019st thou solitude, is not the Earth With various living creatures, and the Aire Replenisht, and all these at thy command To come and play before thee, know\u2019st thou not Thir language and thir wayes, they also know, And reason not contemptibly; with these Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large. So spake the Universal Lord, and seem\u2019d So ordering. I with leave of speech implor\u2019d, And humble deprecation thus repli\u2019d. Let not my words offend thee, Heav\u2019nly Power, My Maker, be propitious while I speak. Hast thou not made me here thy substitute, And these inferiour farr beneath me set? Among unequals what societie Can sort, what harmonie or true delight? Which must be mutual, in proportion due Giv\u2019n and receiv\u2019d; but in disparitie The one intense, the other still remiss Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak Such as I seek, fit to participate All rational delight, wherein the brute Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness; So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin\u2019d; Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape; Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all. Whereto th\u2019 Almighty answer\u2019d, not displeas\u2019d. A nice and suttle happiness I see Thou to thy self proposest, in the choice Of thy Associates, Adam, and wilt taste No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie. What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State, Seem I to thee sufficiently possest Of happiness, or not? who am alone From all Eternitie, for none I know Second to mee or like, equal much less. How have I then with whom to hold converse Save with the Creatures which I made, and those To me inferiour, infinite descents Beneath what other Creatures are to thee? He ceas\u2019d, I lowly answer\u2019d. To attaine The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes All human thoughts come short, Supream of things; Thou in thy", "self art perfet, and in thee Is no deficience found; not so is Man, But in degree, the cause of his desire By conversation with his like to help, Or solace his defects. No need that thou Shouldst propagat, already infinite; And through all numbers absolute, though One; But Man by number is to manifest His single imperfection, and beget Like of his like, his Image multipli\u2019d, In unitie defective, which requires Collateral love, and deerest amitie. Thou in thy secresie although alone, Best with thy self accompanied, seek\u2019st not Social communication, yet so pleas\u2019d, Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt Of Union or Communion, deifi\u2019d; I by conversing cannot these erect From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find. Thus I embold\u2019nd spake, and freedom us\u2019d Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain\u2019d This answer from the gratious voice Divine. Thus farr to try thee, Adam, I was pleas\u2019d, And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone, Which thou hast rightly nam\u2019d, but of thy self, Expressing well the spirit within thee free, My Image, not imparted to the Brute, Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike, And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak\u2019st, Knew it not good for Man to be alone, And no such companie as then thou saw\u2019st Intended thee, for trial onely brought, To see how thou could\u2019st judge of fit and meet: What next I bring shall please thee, be assur\u2019d, Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self, Thy wish, exactly to thy hearts desire. Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now My earthly by his Heav\u2019nly overpowerd, Which it had long stood under, streind to the highth In that celestial Colloquie sublime, As with an object that excels the sense, Dazl\u2019d and spent, sunk down, and sought repair Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call\u2019d By Nature as in aide, and clos\u2019d mine eyes. Mine eyes he clos\u2019d, but op\u2019n left the Cell Of Fancie my internal sight, by which Abstract as in a transe methought I saw, Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape Still glorious before whom awake I stood; Who stooping op\u2019nd my left side, and took From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme, And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound, But suddenly with flesh fill\u2019d up & heal\u2019d: The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands; Under his forming hands a Creature grew, Manlike, but different sex, so lovly faire, That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now Mean, or in her summd up, in her containd And in her looks, which from that time infus\u2019d Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before, And into all things from her Aire inspir\u2019d The spirit of love and amorous delight. She disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak\u2019d To find her, or for ever to deplore Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure: When out of hope, behold her, not farr", "off, Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow To make her amiable: On she came, Led by her Heav\u2019nly Maker, though unseen, And guided by his voice, nor uninformd Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites: Grace was in all her steps, Heav\u2019n in her Eye, In every gesture dignitie and love. I overjoyd could not forbear aloud. This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill\u2019d Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne, Giver of all things faire, but fairest this Of all thy gifts, nor enviest. I now see Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere; And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule. She heard me thus, and though divinely brought, Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie, Her vertue and the conscience of her worth, That would be woo\u2019d, and not unsought be won, Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir\u2019d, The more desirable, or to say all, Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought, Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn\u2019d; I follow\u2019d her, she what was Honour knew, And with obsequious Majestie approv\u2019d My pleaded reason. To the Nuptial Bowre I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav\u2019n, And happie Constellations on that houre Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill; Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires Whisper\u2019d it to the Woods, and from thir wings Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub, Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp. Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss Which I enjoy, and must confess to find In all things else delight indeed, but such As us\u2019d or not, works in the mind no change, Nor vehement desire, these delicacies I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, & Flours, Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here Farr otherwise, transported I behold, Transported touch; here passion first I felt, Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else Superiour and unmov\u2019d, here onely weake Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance. Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part Not proof enough such Object to sustain, Or from my side subducting, took perhaps More then enough; at least on her bestow\u2019d Too much of Ornament, in outward shew Elaborate, of inward less exact. For well I understand in the prime end Of Nature her th\u2019 inferiour, in the mind And inward Faculties, which most excell, In outward also her resembling less His Image who made both, and less expressing The character of that Dominion giv\u2019n O\u2019re other Creatures; yet when I approach Her loveliness, so absolute she seems And in her self compleat, so", "well to know Her own, that what she wills to do or say, Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best; All higher knowledge in her presence falls Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her Looses discount\u2019nanc\u2019t, and like folly shewes; Authoritie and Reason on her waite, As one intended first, not after made Occasionally; and to consummate all, Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat Build in her loveliest, and create an awe About her, as a guard Angelic plac\u2019t. To whom the Angel with contracted brow. Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part; Do thou but thine, and be not diffident Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh, By attributing overmuch to things Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav\u2019st. For what admir\u2019st thou, what transports thee so, An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love, Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self; Then value: Oft times nothing profits more Then self-esteem, grounded on just and right Well manag\u2019d; of that skill the more thou know\u2019st, The more she will acknowledge thee her Head, And to realities yeild all her shows; Made so adorn for thy delight the more, So awful, that with honour thou maist love Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise. But if the sense of touch whereby mankind Is propagated seem such dear delight Beyond all other, think the same voutsaf\u2019t To Cattel and each Beast; which would not be To them made common & divulg\u2019d, if aught Therein enjoy\u2019d were worthy to subdue The Soule of Man, or passion in him move. What higher in her societie thou findst Attractive, human, rational, love still; In loving thou dost well, in passion not, Wherein true Love consists not; love refines The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale By which to heav\u2019nly Love thou maist ascend, Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found. To whom thus half abash\u2019t Adam repli\u2019d. Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught In procreation common to all kindes (Though higher of the genial Bed by far, And with mysterious reverence I deem) So much delights me, as those graceful acts, Those thousand decencies that daily flow From all her words and actions, mixt with Love And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign\u2019d Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule; Harmonie to behold in wedded pair More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare. Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild, Who meet with various objects, from the sense Variously representing; yet still free Approve the best, and follow what I approve. To love thou blam\u2019st me not, for love thou saist Leads up to Heav\u2019n, is both the way and guide; Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask; Love not", "the heav\u2019nly Spirits, and how thir Love Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch? To whom the Angel with a smile that glow\u2019d Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue, Answer\u2019d. Let it suffice thee that thou know\u2019st Us happie, and without Love no happiness. Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy\u2019st (And pure thou wert created) we enjoy In eminence, and obstacle find none Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs: Easier then Air with Air, if Spirits embrace, Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure Desiring; nor restrain\u2019d conveyance need As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul. But I can now no more; the parting Sun Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles Hesperean sets, my Signal to depart. Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all Him whom to love is to obey, and keep His great command; take heed least Passion sway Thy Judgement to do aught, which else free Will Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons The weal or woe in thee is plac\u2019t; beware. I in thy persevering shall rejoyce, And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies. Perfet within, no outward aid require; And all temptation to transgress repel. So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus Follow\u2019d with benediction. Since to part, Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger, Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore. Gentle to me and affable hath been Thy condescension, and shall be honour\u2019d ever With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind Be good and friendly still, and oft return. So parted they, the Angel up to Heav\u2019n From the thick shade, and Adam to his Bowre. THE END OF THE SEVENTH BOOK. PARADISE LOST BOOK VIII. No more of talk where God or Angel Guest With Man, as with his Friend, familiar us\u2019d To sit indulgent, and with him partake Rural repast, permitting him the while Venial discourse unblam\u2019d: I now must change Those Notes to Tragic; foul distrust, and breach Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt And disobedience: On the part of Heav\u2019n Now alienated, distance and distaste, Anger and just rebuke, and judgement giv\u2019n, That brought into this World a world of woe, Sinne and her shadow Death, and Miserie Deaths Harbinger: Sad task, yet argument Not less but more Heroic then the wrauth Of stern Achilles on his Foe pursu\u2019d Thrice Fugitive about Troy Wall; or rage Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous\u2019d, Or Neptun\u2019s ire or Juno\u2019s, that so long Perplex\u2019d the Greek and Cytherea\u2019s Son; If answerable style I can obtaine Of my Celestial Patroness, who deignes Her nightly visitation unimplor\u2019d, And dictates to me slumbring, or inspires Easie my unpremeditated Verse: Since first this subject for Heroic Song Pleas\u2019d me long choosing, and beginning late; Not sedulous by Nature to indite Warrs, hitherto the onely Argument Heroic deem\u2019d, chief maistrie to dissect With long and tedious havoc fabl\u2019d Knights", "In Battels feign\u2019d; the better fortitude Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom Unsung; or to describe Races and Games, Or tilting Furniture, emblazon\u2019d Shields, Impreses quaint, Caparisons and Steeds; Bases and tinsel Trappings, gorgious Knights At Joust and Torneament; then marshal\u2019d Feast Serv\u2019d up in Hall with Sewers, and Seneshals; The skill of Artifice or Office mean, Not that which justly gives Heroic name To Person or to Poem. Mee of these Nor skilld nor studious, higher Argument Remaines, sufficient of it self to raise That name, unless an age too late, or cold Climat, or Years damp my intended wing Deprest, and much they may, if all be mine, Not Hers who brings it nightly to my Ear. The Sun was sunk, and after him the Starr Of Hesperus, whose Office is to bring Twilight upon the Earth, short Arbiter Twixt Day and Night, and now from end to end Nights Hemisphere had veild the Horizon round: When Satan who late fled before the threats Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improv\u2019d In meditated fraud and malice, bent On mans destruction, maugre what might hap Of heavier on himself, fearless return\u2019d. By Night he fled, and at Midnight return\u2019d From compassing the Earth, cautious of day, Since Uriel Regent of the Sun descri\u2019d His entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim That kept thir watch; thence full of anguish driv\u2019n, The space of seven continu\u2019d Nights he rode With darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line He circl\u2019d, four times cross\u2019d the Carr of Night From Pole to Pole, traversing each Colure; On the eighth return\u2019d, and on the Coast averse From entrance or Cherubic Watch, by stealth Found unsuspected way. There was a place, Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change, Where Tigris at the foot of Paradise Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life; In with the River sunk, and with it rose Satan involv\u2019d in rising Mist, then sought Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land From Eden over Pontus, and the Poole Maeotis, up beyond the River Ob; Downward as farr Antartic; and in length West from Orantes to the Ocean barr\u2019d At Darien, thence to the Land where flowes Ganges and Indus: thus the Orb he roam\u2019d With narrow search; and with inspection deep Consider\u2019d every Creature, which of all Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field. Him after long debate, irresolute Of thoughts revolv\u2019d, his final sentence chose Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom To enter, and his dark suggestions hide From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake, Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark, As from his wit and native suttletie Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ\u2019d Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow\u2019r Active within beyond the sense of brute. Thus he resolv\u2019d, but first from inward griefe His bursting passion into plaints thus pour\u2019d: O Earth, how like to", "Heav\u2019n, if not preferrd More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built With second thoughts, reforming what was old! For what God after better worse would build? Terrestrial Heav\u2019n, danc\u2019t round by other Heav\u2019ns That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps, Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems, In thee concentring all thir precious beams Of sacred influence: As God in Heav\u2019n Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou Centring receav\u2019st from all those Orbs; in thee, Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth Of Creatures animate with gradual life Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ\u2019d up in Man. With what delight could I have walkt thee round If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange Of Hill and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines, Now Land, now Sea, & Shores with Forrest crownd, Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these Find place or refuge; and the more I see Pleasures about me, so much more I feel Torment within me, as from the hateful siege Of contraries; all good to me becomes Bane, and in Heav\u2019n much worse would be my state. But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav\u2019n To dwell, unless by maistring Heav\u2019ns Supreame; Nor hope to be my self less miserable By what I seek, but others to make such As I though thereby worse to me redound: For onely in destroying I finde ease To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd, Or won to what may work his utter loss, For whom all this was made, all this will soon Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe, In wo then; that destruction wide may range: To mee shall be the glorie sole among The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr\u2019d What he Almightie styl\u2019d, six Nights and Days Continu\u2019d making, and who knows how long Before had bin contriving, though perhaps Not longer then since I in one Night freed From servitude inglorious welnigh half Th\u2019 Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng Of his adorers: hee to be aveng\u2019d, And to repaire his numbers thus impair\u2019d, Whether such vertue spent of old now faild More Angels to Create, if they at least Are his Created or to spite us more, Determin\u2019d to advance into our room A Creature form\u2019d of Earth, and him endow, Exalted from so base original, With Heav\u2019nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed He effected; Man he made, and for him built Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat, Him Lord pronounc\u2019d, and, O indignitie! Subjected to his service Angel wings, And flaming Ministers to watch and tend Thir earthlie Charge: Of these the vigilance I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds To hide me, and the dark intent I bring. O foul descent! that I", "who erst contended With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime, This essence to incarnate and imbrute, That to the hight of Deitie aspir\u2019d; But what will not Ambition and Revenge Descend to? who aspires must down as low As high he soard, obnoxious first or last To basest things. Revenge, at first though sweet, Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles; Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim\u2019d, Since higher I fall short, on him who next Provokes my envie, this new Favorite Of Heav\u2019n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite, Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais\u2019d From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid. So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie, Like a black mist low creeping, he held on His midnight search, where soonest he might finde The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowl\u2019d, His head the midst, well stor\u2019d with suttle wiles: Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den, Not nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense, In heart or head, possessing soon inspir\u2019d With act intelligential; but his sleep Disturbd not, waiting close th\u2019 approach of Morn. Now whenas sacred Light began to dawne In Eden on the humid Flours, that breathd Thir morning Incense, when all things that breath, From th\u2019 Earths great Altar send up silent praise To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill With gratefull Smell, forth came the human pair And joynd thir vocal Worship to the Quire Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires: Then commune how that day they best may ply Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide. And Eve first to her Husband thus began. Adam, well may we labour still to dress This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour. Our pleasant task enjoyn\u2019d, but till more hands Aid us, the work under our labour grows, Luxurious by restraint; what we by day Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, One night or two with wanton growth derides Tending to wilde. Thou therefore now advise Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present, Let us divide our labours, thou where choice Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon: For while so near each other thus all day Our task we choose, what wonder if no near Looks intervene and smiles, or object new Casual discourse draw on, which intermits Our dayes work brought to little, though begun Early, and th\u2019 hour of Supper comes unearn\u2019d. To whom mild answer Adam thus return\u2019d.", "Sole Eve, Associate sole, to me beyond Compare above all living Creatures deare, Well hast thou motion\u2019d, wel thy thoughts imployd How we might best fulfill the work which here God hath assign\u2019d us, nor of me shalt pass Unprais\u2019d: for nothing lovelier can be found In woman, then to studie houshold good, And good workes in her Husband to promote. Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos\u2019d Labour, as to debarr us when we need Refreshment, whether food, or talk between, Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow, To brute deni\u2019d, and are of Love the food, Love not the lowest end of human life. For not to irksom toile, but to delight He made us, and delight to Reason joyn\u2019d. These paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide As we need walk, till younger hands ere long Assist us: But if much converse perhaps Thee satiate, to short absence I could yeild. For solitude somtimes is best societie, And short retirement urges sweet returne. But other doubt possesses me, least harm Befall thee sever\u2019d from me; for thou knowst What hath bin warn\u2019d us, what malicious Foe Envying our happiness, and of his own Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find His wish and best advantage, us asunder, Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each To other speedie aide might lend at need; Whether his first design be to withdraw Our fealtie from God, or to disturb Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss Enjoy\u2019d by us excites his envie more; Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side That gave thee being, stil shades thee and protects. The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks, Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies, Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. To whom the Virgin Majestie of Eve, As one who loves, and some unkindness meets, With sweet austeer composure thus reply\u2019d. Ofspring of Heav\u2019n and Earth, and all Earths Lord, That such an enemie we have, who seeks Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne, And from the parting Angel over-heard As in a shadie nook I stood behind, Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours. But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt To God or thee, because we have a foe May tempt it, I expected not to hear. His violence thou fearst not, being such, As wee, not capable of death or paine, Can either not receave, or can repell. His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love Can by his fraud be shak\u2019n or seduc\u2019t; Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy Brest, Adam, misthought of her to thee so dear? To whom with healing words Adam reply\u2019d. Daughter of God and", "Man, immortal Eve, For such thou art, from sin and blame entire: Not diffident of thee do I dissuade Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid Th\u2019 attempt it self, intended by our Foe. For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos\u2019d Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne And anger wouldst resent the offer\u2019d wrong, Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then, If such affront I labour to avert From thee alone, which on us both at once The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare, Or daring, first on mee th\u2019 assault shall light. Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn; Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce Angels, nor think superfluous others aid. I from the influence of thy looks receave Access in every Vertue, in thy sight More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on, Shame to be overcome or over-reacht Would utmost vigor raise, and rais\u2019d unite. Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel When I am present, and thy trial choose With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri\u2019d. So spake domestick Adam in his care And Matrimonial Love, but Eve, who thought Less attributed to her Faith sincere, Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd. If this be our condition, thus to dwell In narrow circuit strait\u2019nd by a Foe, Suttle or violent, we not endu\u2019d Single with like defence, wherever met, How are we happie, still in fear of harm? But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem Of our integritie: his foul esteeme Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns Foul on himself; then wherfore shund or feard By us? who rather double honour gaine From his surmise prov\u2019d false, finde peace within, Favour from Heav\u2019n, our witness from th\u2019 event. And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid Alone, without exterior help sustaind? Let us not then suspect our happie State Left so imperfet by the Maker wise, As not secure to single or combin\u2019d. Fraile is our happiness, if this be so, And Eden were no Eden thus expos\u2019d. To whom thus Adam fervently repli\u2019d. O Woman, best are all things as the will Of God ordaind them, his creating hand Nothing imperfet or deficient left Of all that he Created, much less Man, Or ought that might his happie State secure, Secure from outward force; within himself The danger lies, yet lies within his power: Against his will he can receave no harme. But God left free the Will, for what obeyes Reason, is free, and Reason he made right, But bid her well beware, and still erect, Least by some faire appeering good surpris\u2019d She dictate false, and missinforme the Will To do what God expresly hath forbid. Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes, That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me.", "Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve, Since Reason not impossibly may meet Some specious object by the Foe subornd, And fall into deception unaware, Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd. Seek not temptation then, which to avoide Were better, and most likelie if from mee Thou sever not; Trial will come unsought. Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve First thy obedience; th\u2019 other who can know, Not seeing thee attempted, who attest? But if thou think, trial unsought may finde Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst, Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; Go in thy native innocence, relie On what thou hast of vertue, summon all, For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine. So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but Eve Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli\u2019d. With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought, May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar\u2019d, The willinger I goe, nor much expect A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek; So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light Oread or Dryad, or of Delia\u2019s Traine, Betook her to the Groves, but Delia\u2019s self In gate surpass\u2019d and Goddess-like deport, Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd, But with such Gardning Tools as Are yet rude, Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought, To Pales, or Pomona, thus adornd, Likest she seemd, Pomona when she fled Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her Prime, Yet Virgin of Proserpina from Jove. Her long with ardent look his Eye pursu\u2019d Delighted, but desiring more her stay. Oft he to her his charge of quick returne, Repeated, shee to him as oft engag\u2019d To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre, And all things in best order to invite Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose. O much deceav\u2019d, much failing, hapless Eve, Of thy presum\u2019d return! event perverse! Thou never from that houre in Paradise Foundst either sweet repast, or found repose; Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades Waited with hellish rancor imminent To intercept thy way, or send thee back Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss. For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend, Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come, And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde The onely two of Mankinde, but in them The whole included Race, his purposd prey. In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay, Thir tendance or Plantation for delight, By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet He sought them both, but wish\u2019d his hap might find Eve separate, he wish\u2019d, but not with hope Of what so seldom chanc\u2019d, when to his wish, Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies, Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she", "stood, Half spi\u2019d, so thick the Roses bushing round About her glowd, oft stooping to support Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold, Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while, Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour, From her best prop so farr, and storn so nigh. Neererhe drew, and many a walk travers\u2019d Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme, Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen Among thick-wov\u2019n Arborets and Flours Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of Eve: Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign\u2019d Or of reviv\u2019d Adonis, or renownd Alcinous, host of old Laertes Son, Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King Held dalliance with his faire Egyptian Spouse. Much hee the Place admir\u2019d, the Person more. As one who long in populous City pent, Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire, Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight, The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine, Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound; If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass, What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more, She most, and in her look summs all Delight. Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of Eve Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav\u2019nly forme Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine, Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire Of gesture or lest action overawd His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav\u2019d His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought: That space the Evil one abstracted stood From his own evil, and for the time remaind Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm\u2019d, Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge; But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes, Though in mid Heav\u2019n, soon ended his delight, And tortures him now more, the more he sees Of pleasure not for him ordain\u2019d: then soon Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. Thoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet Compulsion thus transported to forget What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy, Save what is in destroying, other joy To me is lost. Then let me not let pass Occasion which now smiles, behold alone The Woman, opportune to all attempts, Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh, Whose higher intellectual more I shun, And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould, Foe not informidable, exempt from wound, I not; so much hath Hell debas\u2019d, and paine Infeebl\u2019d me, to what I was in Heav\u2019n. Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods, Not terrible, though terrour be in Love And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate, Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign\u2019d, The way which", "to her ruin now I tend. So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos\u2019d In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward Eve Address\u2019d his way, not with indented wave, Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare, Circular base of rising foulds, that tour\u2019d Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes; With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape, And lovely, never since of Serpent kind Lovelier, not those that in Illyria chang\u2019d Hermione and Cadmus, or the God In Epidaurus; nor to which transformd Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline was seen, Hee with Olympias, this with her who bore Scipio the highth of Rome. With tract oblique At first, as one who sought access, but feard To interrupt, side-long he works his way. As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile; So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve, To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us\u2019d To such disport before her through the Field, From every Beast, more duteous at her call, Then at Circean call the Herd disguis\u2019d. Hee boulder now, uncall\u2019d before her stood; But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd His turret Crest, and sleek enamel\u2019d Neck, Fawning, and lick\u2019d the ground whereon she trod. His gentle dumb expression turnd at length The Eye of Eve to mark his play; he glad Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue Organic, or impulse of vocal Air, His fraudulent temptation thus began. Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm Thy looks, the Heav\u2019n of mildness, with disdain, Displeas\u2019d that I approach thee thus, and gaze Insatiate, I thus single; nor have feard Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir\u2019d. Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire, Thee all living things gaze on, all things thine By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore With ravishment beheld, there best beheld Where universally admir\u2019d; but here In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among, Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne Half what in thee is fair, one man except, Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen A Goddess among Gods, ador\u2019d and serv\u2019d By Angels numberless, thy daily Train. So gloz\u2019d the Tempter, and his Proem tun\u2019d; Into the Heart of Eve his words made way, Though at the voice much marveling; at length Not unamaz\u2019d she thus in answer spake. What may this mean? Language of Man pronounc\u2019t By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest? The first at lest of these I thought deni\u2019d To Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day Created mute to all articulat sound; The latter I demurre, for in thir looks Much reason, and in thir actions oft", "appeers. Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field I knew, but not with human voice endu\u2019d; Redouble then this miracle, and say, How cam\u2019st thou speakable of mute, and how To me so friendly grown above the rest Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight? Say, for such wonder claims attention due. To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply\u2019d. Empress of this fair World, resplendent Eve, Easie to mee it is to tell thee all What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd: I was at first as other Beasts that graze The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low, As was my food, nor aught but food discern\u2019d Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high: Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc\u2019d A goodly Tree farr distant to behold Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt, Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze; When from the boughes a savorie odour blow\u2019n, Grateful to appetite, more pleas\u2019d my sense Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn, Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play. To satisfie the sharp desire I had Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv\u2019d Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once, Powerful perswaders, quick\u2019nd at the scent Of that alluring fruit, urg\u2019d me so keene. About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon, For high from ground the branches would require Thy utmost reach or Adams: Round the Tree All other Beasts that saw, with like desire Longing and envying stood, but could not reach. Amid the Tree now got, where plentie hung Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill I spar\u2019d not, for such pleasure till that hour At Feed or Fountain never had I found. Sated at length, ere long I might perceave Strange alteration in me, to degree Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind. Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind Considerd all things visible in Heav\u2019n, Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good; But all that fair and good in thy Divine Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav\u2019nly Ray United I beheld; no Fair to thine Equivalent or second, which compel\u2019d Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come And gaze, and worship thee of right declar\u2019d Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame. So talk\u2019d the spirited sly Snake; and Eve Yet more amaz\u2019d unwarie thus reply\u2019d. Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov\u2019d: But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far? For many are the Trees of God that grow In Paradise, and various, yet unknown To us, in such abundance lies our choice, As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht, Still hanging incorruptible, till men Grow up to thir provision, and more hands Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth. To whom the", "wilie Adder, blithe and glad. Empress, the way is readie, and not long, Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat, Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon. Lead then, said Eve. Hee leading swiftly rowld In tangles, and make intricate seem strait, To mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy Bright\u2019ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night Condenses, and the cold invirons round, Kindl\u2019d through agitation to a Flame, Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends, Hovering and blazing with delusive Light, Misleads th\u2019 amaz\u2019d Night-wanderer from his way To Boggs and Mires, & oft through Pond or Poole, There swallow\u2019d up and lost, from succour farr. So glister\u2019d the dire Snake and into fraud Led Eve our credulous Mother, to the Tree Of prohibition, root of all our woe; Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. Serpent, we might have spar\u2019d our coming hither, Fruitless to me, though Fruit be here to excess, The credit of whose vertue rest with thee, Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects. But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch; God so commanded, and left that Command Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law. To whom the Tempter guilefully repli\u2019d. Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate, Yet Lords declar\u2019d of all in Earth or Aire? To whom thus Eve yet sinless. Of the Fruit Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate, But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die. She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love To Man, and indignation at his wrong, New part puts on, and as to passion mov\u2019d, Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely, and in act Rais\u2019d, as of som great matter to begin. As when of old som Orator renound In Athens or free Rome, where Eloquence Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest, Stood in himself collected, while each part, Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue, Somtimes in highth began, as no delay Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right. So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown The Tempter all impassiond thus began. O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant, Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power Within me cleere, not onely to discerne Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes Of highest Agents, deemd however wise. Queen of this Universe, doe not believe Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die: How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life To Knowledge? By the Threatner, look on mee, Mee who have touch\u2019d", "and tasted, yet both live, And life more perfet have attaind then Fate Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot. Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast Is open? or will God incense his ire For such a pretty Trespass, and not praise Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain Of Death denounc\u2019t, whatever thing Death be, Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil; Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd? God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid: Your feare it self of Death removes the feare. Why then was this forbid? Why but to awe, Why but to keep ye low and ignorant, His worshippers; he knows that in the day Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere, Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then Op\u2019nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods, Knowing both Good and Evil as they know. That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man, Internal Man, is but proportion meet, I of brute human, yee of human Gods. So ye shalt die perhaps, by putting off Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht, Though threat\u2019nd, which no worse then this can bring And what are Gods that Man may not become As they, participating God-like food? The Gods are first, and that advantage use On our belief, that all from them proceeds, I question it, for this fair Earth I see, Warm\u2019d by the Sun, producing every kind, Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos\u2019d Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree, That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies Th\u2019 offence, that Man should thus attain to know? What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree Impart against his will if all be his? Or is it envie, and can envie dwell In heav\u2019nly brests? these, these and many more Causes import your need of this fair Fruit. Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste. He ended, and his words replete with guile Into her heart too easie entrance won: Fixt on the Fruit she gaz\u2019d, which to behold Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn\u2019d With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth; Meanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wak\u2019d An eager appetite, rais\u2019d by the smell So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire, Inclinable now grown to touch or taste, Sollicited her longing eye; yet first Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus\u2019d. Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits, Though kept from Man, & worthy to be admir\u2019d, Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay Gave elocution to the mute, and taught The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise: Thy praise hee", "also who forbids thy use, Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil; Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good By thee communicated, and our want: For good unknown, sure is not had, or had And yet unknown, is as not had at all. In plain then, what forbids he but to know, Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise? Such prohibitions binde not. But if Death Bind us with after-bands, what profits then Our inward freedom? In the day we eate Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die. How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat\u2019n and lives, And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes, Irrational till then. For us alone Was death invented? or to us deni\u2019d This intellectual food, for beasts reserv\u2019d? For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy The good befall\u2019n him, Author unsuspect, Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile. What fear I then, rather what know to feare Under this ignorance of Good and Evil, Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie? Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine, Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste, Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind? So saying, her rash hand in evil hour Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck\u2019d, she eat: Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe, That all was lost. Back to the Thicket slunk The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for Eve Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd, In Fruit she never tasted, whether true Or fansied so, through expectation high Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought. Greedily she ingorg\u2019d without restraint, And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length, And hight\u2019nd as with Wine, jocond and boon, Thus to her self she pleasingly began. O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees In Paradise, of operation blest To Sapience, hitherto obscur\u2019d, infam\u2019d, And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end Created; but henceforth my early care, Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease Of thy full branches offer\u2019d free to all; Till dieted by thee I grow mature In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know; Though others envie what they cannot give; For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here Thus grown. Experience, next to thee I owe, Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind In ignorance, thou op\u2019nst Wisdoms way, And giv\u2019st access, though secret she retire. And I perhaps am secret; Heav\u2019n is high, High and remote to see from thence distinct Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps May have diverted from", "continual watch Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies About him. But to Adam in what sort Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known As yet my change, and give him to partake Full happiness with mee, or rather not, But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power Without Copartner? so to add what wants In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love, And render me more equal, and perhaps A thing not undesireable, somtime Superior; for inferior who is free? This may be well: but what if God have seen, And Death ensue? then I shall be no more, And Adam wedded to another Eve, Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct; A death to think. Confirm\u2019d then I resolve, Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe: So dear I love him, that with him all deaths I could endure; without him live no life. So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd, But first low Reverence don, as to the power That dwelt within, whose presence had infus\u2019d Into the plant sciential sap, deriv\u2019d From Nectar, drink of Gods. Adam the while Waiting desirous her return, had wove Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen. Great joy he promis\u2019d to his thoughts, and new Solace in her return, so long delay\u2019d; Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill, Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt; And forth to meet her went, the way she took That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met, Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil\u2019d, New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus\u2019d. To him she hasted, in her face excuse Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt, Which with bland words at will she thus addrest. Hast thou not wonderd, Adam, at my stay? Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv\u2019d Thy presence, agonie of love till now Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more Mean I to trie, what rash untri\u2019d I sought, The paine of absence from thy sight. But strange Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare: This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown Op\u2019ning the way, but of Divine effect To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste; And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise, Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying, Hath eat\u2019n of the fruit, and is become, Not dead, as we are threatn\u2019d, but thenceforth Endu\u2019d with human voice and human sense, Reasoning to admiration, and with mee Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I Have also tasted, and have also found Th\u2019 effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes, Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart, And growing up to Godhead; which for thee Chiefly I sought, without thee", "can despise. For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss, Tedious, unshar\u2019d with thee, and odious soon. Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love; Least thou not tasting, different degree Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit. Thus Eve with Countnance blithe her storie told; But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd. On th\u2019 other side, Adam, soon as he heard The fatal Trespass don by Eve, amaz\u2019d, Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax\u2019d; From his slack hand the Garland wreath\u2019d for Eve Down drop\u2019d, and all the faded Roses shed: Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length First to himself he inward silence broke. O fairest of Creation, last and best Of all Gods Works, Creature in whom excell\u2019d Whatever can to fight or thought be found, Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost, Defac\u2019t, deflourd, and now to Death devote? Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress The strict forbiddance, how to violate The sacred Fruit forbidd\u2019n! som cursed fraud Of Enemie hath beguil\u2019d thee, yet unknown, And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee Certain my resolution is to Die; How can I live without thee, how forgoe Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn\u2019d, To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn? Should God create another Eve, and I Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee Would never from my heart; no no, I feel The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh, Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. So having said, as one from sad dismay Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd Submitting to what seemd remediless, Thus in calme mood his Words to Eve he turnd. Bold deed thou hast presum\u2019d, adventrous Eve, And peril great provok\u2019t, who thus hast dar\u2019d Had it bin onely coveting to Eye That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence, Much more to taste it under banne to touch. But past who can recall, or don undoe? Not God omnipotent, for Fate, yet so Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit, Profan\u2019d first by the Serpent, by him first Made common and unhallowd: ere one tastes; Nor yet on him found deadly; he yet lives, Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man Higher degree of Life, inducement strong To us, as likely tasting to attaine Proportional ascent, which cannot be But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods. Nor can I think that God, Creator wise, Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy Us his prime Creatures, dignifi\u2019d so high, Set over all his Works, which in our Fall, For us created, needs with us must faile, Dependent made; so God shall uncreate, Be frustrate, do, undo,", "and labour loose, Not well conceav\u2019d of God, who though his Power Creation could repeate, yet would be loath Us to abolish, least the Adversary Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God Most Favors, who can please him long? Mee first He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next? Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe. However I with thee have fixt my Lot, Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life; So forcible within my heart I feel The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne, My own in thee, for what thou art is mine; Our State cannot be severd, we are one, One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self. So Adam, and thus Eve to him repli\u2019d. O glorious trial of exceeding Love, Illustrious evidence, example high! Ingaging me to emulate, but short Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine, Adam, from whose deare side I boast me sprung, And gladly of our Union heare thee speak, One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff This day affords, declaring thee resolvd, Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare, To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime, If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit, Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds, Direct, or by occasion hath presented This happie trial of thy Love, which else So eminently never had bin known. Were it I thought Death menac\u2019t would ensue This my attempt, I would sustain alone The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur\u2019d Remarkably so late of thy so true, So faithful Love unequald; but I feel Farr otherwise th\u2019 event, not Death, but Life Augmented, op\u2019nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes, Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh. On my experience, Adam, freely taste, And fear of Death deliver to the Windes. So saying, she embrac\u2019d him, and for joy Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love Had so enobl\u2019d, as of choice to incurr Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death. In recompence (for such compliance bad Such recompence best merits) from the bough She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit With liberal hand: he scrupl\u2019d not to eat Against his better knowledge, not deceav\u2019d, But fondly overcome with Femal charm. Earth trembl\u2019d from her entrails, as again In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan, Skie lowr\u2019d, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin Original; while Adam took no thought, Eating his fill, nor Eve to iterate Her former trespass fear\u2019d, the more to soothe Him with her lov\u2019d societie, that now As with new Wine intoxicated both They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel Divinitie within them breeding wings Wherewith to", "scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit Farr other operation first displaid, Carnal desire enflaming, hee on Eve Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne: Till Adam thus \u2019gan Eve to dalliance move. Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste, And elegant, of Sapience no small part, Since to each meaning savour we apply, And Palate call judicious; I the praise Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey\u2019d. Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain\u2019d From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be In things to us forbidden, it might be wish\u2019d, For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten. But come, so well refresh\u2019t, now let us play, As meet is, after such delicious Fare; For never did thy Beautie since the day I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn\u2019d With all perfections, so enflame my sense With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree. So said he, and forbore not glance or toy Of amorous intent, well understood Of Eve, whose Eye darted contagious Fire. Her hand he seis\u2019d, and to a shadie bank, Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr\u2019d He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch, Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel, And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap. There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale, The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep Oppress\u2019d them, wearied with thir amorous play. Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit, That with exhilerating vapour bland About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers Made erre, was now exhal\u2019d, and grosser sleep Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose As from unrest, and each the other viewing, Soon found thir Eyes how op\u2019nd, and thir minds How dark\u2019nd; innocence, that as a veile Had shadow\u2019d them from knowing ill, was gon, Just confidence, and native righteousness, And honour from about them, naked left To guiltie shame hee cover\u2019d, but his Robe Uncover\u2019d more. So rose the Danite strong Herculean Samson from the Harlot-lap Of Philistean Dalilah, and wak\u2019d Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face Confounded long they sate, as struck\u2019n mute, Till Adam, though not less then Eve abasht, At length gave utterance to these words constraind. O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give care To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall, False in our promis\u2019d Rising; since our Eyes Op\u2019nd we find indeed, and find we know Both Good and Evil, Good lost and Evil got, Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know, Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void, Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie, Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind, And in our Faces evident the signes Of foul", "concupiscence; whence evil store; Even shame, the last of evils; of the first Be sure then. How shall I behold the face Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy And rapture so oft beheld? those heav\u2019nly shapes Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze Insufferably bright. O might I here In solitude live savage, in some glad Obscur\u2019d, where highest Woods impenetrable To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad, And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines, Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs Hide me, where I may never see them more. But let us now, as in bad plight, devise What best may for the present serve to hide The Parts of each from other, that seem most To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen, Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd, And girded on our loyns, may cover round Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame, There sit not, and reproach us as unclean. So counsel\u2019d hee, and both together went Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown\u2019d, But such as at this day to Indians known In Malabar or Decan spreds her Armes Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade High overarch\u2019t, and echoing Walks between; There oft the Indian Herdsman shunning heate Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves They gatherd, broad as Amazonian Targe, And with what skill they had, together sowd, To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike To that first naked Glorie. Such of late Columbus found th\u2019 American to girt With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores. Thus fenc\u2019t, and as they thought, thir shame in part Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind, They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate, Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore Thir inward State of Mind, calme Region once And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent: For Understanding rul\u2019d not, and the Will Heard not her lore, both in subjection now To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe Usurping over sovran Reason claimd Superior sway: From thus distemperd brest, Adam, estrang\u2019d in look and alterd stile, Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewd. Would thou hadst heark\u2019nd to my words, & stai\u2019d With me, as I besought thee, when that strange Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn, I know not whence possessd thee; we had then Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild Of all our good, sham\u2019d, naked, miserable. Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile. To whom soon mov\u2019d with touch of", "blame thus Eve. What words have past thy Lips, Adam severe, Imput\u2019st thou that to my default, or will Of wandering, as thou call\u2019st it, which who knows But might as ill have happ\u2019nd thou being by, Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou bin there, Or bere th\u2019 attempt, thou couldst not have discernd Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake; No ground of enmitie between us known, Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme. Was I to have never parted from thy side? As good have grown there still a liveless Rib. Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head Command me absolutely not to go, Going into such danger as thou saidst? Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay, Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss. Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent, Neither had I transgress\u2019d, nor thou with mee. To whom then first incenst Adam repli\u2019d. Is this the Love, is the recompence Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve, exprest Immutable when thou wert lost, not I, Who might have liv\u2019d and joyd immortal bliss, Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee: And am I now upbraided, as the cause Of thy transgressing? not enough severe, It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more? I warn\u2019d thee, I admonish\u2019d thee, foretold The danger, and the lurking Enemie That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force, And force upon free Will hath here no place. But confidence then bore thee on, secure Either to meet no danger, or to finde Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps I also err\u2019d in overmuch admiring What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue That errour now, which is become my crime, And thou th\u2019 accuser. Thus it shall befall Him who to worth in Women overtrusting Lets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook, And left to her self, if evil thence ensue, Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse. Thus they in mutual accusation spent The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning And of thir vain contest appeer\u2019d no end. THE END OF THE EIGHTH BOOK. PARADISE LOST BOOK IX. Meanwhile the hainous and despightfull act Of Satan done in Paradise, and how Hee in the Serpent had perverted Eve, Her Husband shee, to taste the fatall fruit, Was known in Heav\u2019n; for what can scape the Eye Of God All-seeing, or deceave his Heart Omniscient, who in all things wise and just, Hinder\u2019d not Satan to attempt the minde Of Man, with strength entire, and free Will arm\u2019d, Complete to have discover\u2019d and repulst Whatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend. For still they knew, and ought to have still remember\u2019d The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit, Whoever tempted; which they not obeying, Incurr\u2019d, what could they less, the penaltie, And manifold in sin, deserv\u2019d to fall. Up into Heav\u2019n from Paradise in hast Th\u2019", "Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad For Man, for of his state by this they knew, Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln Entrance unseen. Soon as th\u2019 unwelcome news From Earth arriv\u2019d at Heaven Gate, displeas\u2019d All were who heard, dim sadness did not spare That time Celestial visages, yet mixt With pitie, violated not thir bliss. About the new-arriv\u2019d, in multitudes Th\u2019 ethereal People ran, to hear and know How all befell: they towards the Throne Supream Accountable made haste to make appear With righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance, And easily approv\u2019d; when the most High Eternal Father from his secret Cloud, Amidst in Thunder utter\u2019d thus his voice. Assembl\u2019d Angels, and ye Powers return\u2019d From unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid, Nor troubl\u2019d at these tidings from the Earth, Which your sincerest care could not prevent, Foretold so lately what would come to pass, When first this Tempter cross\u2019d the Gulf from Hell. I told ye then he should prevail and speed On his bad Errand, Man should be seduc\u2019t And flatter\u2019d out of all, believing lies Against his Maker; no Decree of mine Concurring to necessitate his Fall, Or touch with lightest moment of impulse His free Will, to her own inclining left In eevn scale. But fall\u2019n he is, and now What rests, but that the mortal Sentence pass On his transgression, Death denounc\u2019t that day, Which he presumes already vain and void, Because not yet inflicted, as he fear\u2019d, By some immediate stroak; but soon shall find Forbearance no acquittance ere day end. Justice shall not return as bountie scorn\u2019d. But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee Vicegerent Son, to thee I have transferr\u2019d All Judgement, whether in Heav\u2019n, or Earth; or Hell. Easie it may be seen that I intend Mercie collegue with Justice, sending thee Mans Friend, his Mediator, his design\u2019d Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie, And destin\u2019d Man himself to judge Man fall\u2019n. So spake the Father, and unfoulding bright Toward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son Blaz\u2019d forth unclouded Deitie; he full Resplendent all his Father manifest Express\u2019d, and thus divinely answer\u2019d milde. Father Eternal, thine is to decree, Mine both in Heav\u2019n and Earth to do thy will Supream, that thou in mee thy Son belov\u2019d Mayst ever rest well pleas\u2019d. I go to judge On Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst, Whoever judg\u2019d, the worst on mee must light, When time shall be, for so I undertook Before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine Of right, that I may mitigate thir doom On me deriv\u2019d, yet I shall temper so Justice with Mercie, as may illustrate most Them fully satisfied, and thee appease. Attendance none shall need, nor Train, where none Are to behold the Judgement, but the judg\u2019d, Those two; the third best absent is condemn\u2019d, Convict by flight, and Rebel to all Law Conviction to the Serpent none belongs. Thus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose Of high collateral", "glorie: him Thrones and Powers, Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant Accompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence Eden and all the Coast in prospect lay. Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing\u2019d. Now was the Sun in Western cadence low From Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour To fan the Earth now wak\u2019d, and usher in The Eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard Now walking in the Garden, by soft windes Brought to thir Ears, while day declin\u2019d, they heard And from his presence hid themselves among The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God Approaching, thus to Adam call\u2019d aloud. Where art thou Adam, wont with joy to meet My coming seen far off? I miss thee here, Not pleas\u2019d, thus entertaind with solitude, Where obvious dutie erewhile appear\u2019d unsaught: Or come I less conspicuous, or what change Absents thee, or what chance detains? Come forth. He came, and with him Eve, more loth, though first To offend, discount\u2019nanc\u2019t both, and discompos\u2019d; Love was not in thir looks, either to God Or to each other, but apparent guilt, And shame, and perturbation, and despaire, Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile. Whence Adam faultring long, thus answer\u2019d brief. I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice Affraid, being naked, hid my self. To whom The gracious Judge without revile repli\u2019d. My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear\u2019d, But still rejoyc\u2019t, how is it now become So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat? To whom thus Adam sore beset repli\u2019d. O Heav\u2019n! in evil strait this day I stand Before my Judge, either to undergoe My self the total Crime, or to accuse My other self, the partner of my life; Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines, I should conceal, and not expose to blame By my complaint; but strict necessitie Subdues me, and calamitous constraint, Least on my head both sin and punishment, However insupportable, be all Devolv\u2019d; though should I hold my peace, yet thou Wouldst easily detect what I conceale. This Woman whom thou mad\u2019st to be my help, And gav\u2019st me as thy perfet gift, so good, So fit, so acceptable, so Divine, That from her hand I could suspect no ill, And what she did, whatever in it self, Her doing seem\u2019d to justifie the deed; Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate. To whom the sovran Presence thus repli\u2019d. Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide, Superior, or but equal, that to her Thou did\u2019st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place Wherein God set thee above her made of thee, And for thee, whose perfection", "farr excell\u2019d Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd She was indeed, and lovely to attract Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts Were such as under Government well seem\u2019d, Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part And person, had\u2019st thou known thy self aright. So having said, he thus to Eve in few: Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done? To whom sad Eve with shame nigh overwhelm\u2019d, Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli\u2019d. The Serpent me beguil\u2019d and I did eate. Which when the Lord God heard, without delay To Judgement he proceeded on th\u2019 accus\u2019d Serpent though brute, unable to transferre The Guilt on him who made him instrument Of mischief, and polluted from the end Of his Creation; justly then accurst, As vitiated in Nature: more to know Concern\u2019d not Man (since he no further knew) Nor alter\u2019d his offence; yet God at last To Satan first in sin his doom apply\u2019d, Though in mysterious terms, judg\u2019d as then best: And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall. Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst Above all Cattel, each Beast of the Field; Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe, And dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life. Between Thee and the Woman I will put Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed; Her Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel. So spake this Oracle, then verifi\u2019d When Jesus son of Mary second Eve, Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav\u2019n, Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht In open shew, and with ascention bright Captivity led captive through the Aire, The Realme it self of Satan long usurpt, Whom he shall tread at last under our feet; Eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise, And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn\u2019d. Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule. On Adam last thus judgement he pronounc\u2019d. Because thou hast heark\u2019nd to the voice of thy Wife, And eaten of the Tree concerning which I charg\u2019d thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof, Curs\u2019d is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life; Thornes also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth Unbid, and thou shalt eate th\u2019 Herb of th\u2019 Field, In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eate Bread, Till thou return unto the ground, for thou Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth, For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne. So judg\u2019d he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent, And th\u2019 instant stroke of Death denounc\u2019t that day Remov\u2019d farr off; then pittying how they stood Before him naked to the aire, that now Must suffer change, disdain\u2019d not to begin Thenceforth", "the forme of servant to assume, As when he wash\u2019d his servants feet, so now As Father of his Familie he clad Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain, Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid; And thought not much to cloath his Enemies: Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness, Araying cover\u2019d from his Fathers sight. To him with swift ascent he up returnd, Into his blissful bosom reassum\u2019d In glory as of old, to him appeas\u2019d All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man Recounted, mixing intercession sweet. Meanwhile ere thus was sin\u2019d and judg\u2019d on Earth, Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death, In counterview within the Gates, that now Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame Farr into Chaos, since the Fiend pass\u2019d through, Sin opening, who thus now to Death began. O Son, why sit we here each other viewing Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides For us his ofspring deare? It cannot be But that success attends him; if mishap, Ere this he had return\u2019d, with fury driv\u2019n By his Avenger, since no place like this Can fit his punishment, or their revenge. Methinks I feel new strength within me rise, Wings growing, and Dominion giv\u2019n me large Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on, Or sympathie, or som connatural force Powerful at greatest distance to unite With secret amity things of like kinde By secretest conveyance. Thou my Shade Inseparable must with mee along: For Death from Sin no power can separate. But least the difficultie of passing back Stay his returne perhaps over this Gulfe Impassable, impervious, let us try Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine Not unagreeable, to found a path Over this Maine from Hell to that new World Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument Of merit high to all th\u2019 infernal Host, Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse, Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead. Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn By this new felt attraction and instinct. Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon. Goe whither Fate and inclination strong Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste The savour of Death from all things there that live: Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid. So saying, with delight he snuff\u2019d the smell Of mortal change on Earth. As when a flock Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote, Against the day of Battel, to a Field, Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur\u2019d With sent of living Carcasses design\u2019d For death, the following day, in bloodie fight. So sented the grim Feature, and upturn\u2019d His Nostril wide into the murkie Air, Sagacious of his Quarrey from so farr. Then Both from out", "Hell Gates into the waste Wide Anarchie of Chaos damp and dark Flew divers, & with Power (thir Power was great) Hovering upon the Waters; what they met Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea Tost up and down, together crowded drove From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell. As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse Upon the Cronian Sea, together drive Mountains of Ice, that stop th\u2019 imagin\u2019d way Beyond Petsora Eastward, to the rich Cathaian Coast. The aggregated Soyle Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry, As with a Trident smote, and fix\u2019t as firm As Delos floating once; the rest his look Bound with Gorgonian rigor not to move, And with Asphaltic slime; broad as the Gate, Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather\u2019d beach They fasten\u2019d, and the Mole immense wraught on Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall Immoveable of this now fenceless world Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell. So, if great things to small may be compar\u2019d, Xerxes, the Libertie of Greece to yoke, From Susa his Memnonian Palace high Came to the Sea, and over Hellespont Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joyn\u2019d, And scourg\u2019d with many a stroak th\u2019 indignant waves. Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock Over the vext Abyss, following the track Of Satan, to the selfsame place where hee First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe From out of Chaos to the outside bare Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made And durable; and now in little space The Confines met of Empyrean Heav\u2019n And of this World, and on the left hand Hell With long reach interpos\u2019d; three sev\u2019ral wayes In sight, to each of these three places led. And now thir way to Earth they had descri\u2019d, To Paradise first tending, when behold Satan in likeness of an Angel bright Betwixt the Centaure and the Scorpion stearing His Zenith, while the Sun in Aries rose: Disguis\u2019d he came, but those his Children dear Thir Parent soon discern\u2019d, though in disguise. Hee, after Eve seduc\u2019t, unminded slunk Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought Vain covertures; but when he saw descend The Son of God to judge them, terrifi\u2019d Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth Might suddenly inflict; that past, return\u2019d By Night, and listning where the hapless Paire Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint, Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood Not instant, but of future time. With joy And tidings fraught, to Hell he now return\u2019d, And at the brink of Chaos, neer the foot Of this new wondrous Pontifice,", "unhop\u2019t Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear. Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas\u2019d. Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke. O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds, Thy Trophies, which thou view\u2019st as not thine own, Thou art thir Author and prime Architect: For I no sooner in my Heart divin\u2019d, My Heart, which by a secret harmonie Still moves with thine, joyn\u2019d in connexion sweet, That thou on Earth hadst prosper\u2019d, which thy looks Now also evidence, but straight I felt Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt That I must after thee with this thy Son; Such fatal consequence unites us three: Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds, Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure Detain from following thy illustrious track. Thou hast atchiev\u2019d our libertie, confin\u2019d Within Hell Gates till now, thou us impow\u2019rd To fortifie thus farr, and overlay With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss. Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain\u2019d With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng\u2019d Our foile in Heav\u2019n; here thou shalt Monarch reign, There didst not; there let him still Victor sway, As Battel hath adjudg\u2019d, from this new World Retiring, by his own doom alienated, And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide Of all things, parted by th\u2019 Empyreal bounds, His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World, Or trie thee now more dang\u2019rous to his Throne. Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad. Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both, High proof ye now have giv\u2019n to be the Race Of Satan (for I glorie in the name, Antagonist of Heav\u2019ns Almightie King) Amply have merited of me, of all Th\u2019 Infernal Empire, that so neer Heav\u2019ns dore Triumphal with triumphal act have met, Mine with this glorious Work, & made one Realm Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent Of easie thorough-fare. Therefore while I Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease To my associate Powers, them to acquaint With these successes, and with them rejoyce, You two this way, among those numerous Orbs All yours, right down to Paradise descend; There dwell & Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth Dominion exercise and in the Aire, Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar\u2019d, Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. My Substitutes I send ye, and Create Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now My hold of this new Kingdom all depends, Through Sin to Death expos\u2019d by my exploit. If your joynt power prevaile, th\u2019 affaires of Hell No detriment need feare, goe and be strong. So saying he dismiss\u2019d them, they with speed Thir course through thickest Constellations held Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan, And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips Then sufferd. Th\u2019 other way Satan", "went down The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side Disparted Chaos over built exclaimd, And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild, That scorn\u2019d his indignation: through the Gate, Wide open and unguarded, Satan pass\u2019d, And all about found desolate; for those Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge, Flown to the upper World; the rest were all Farr to the inland retir\u2019d, about the walls Of Pandemonium, Citie and proud seate Of Lucifer, so by allusion calld, Of that bright Starr to Satan paragond. There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand In Council sate, sollicitous what chance Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee Departing gave command, and they observ\u2019d. As when the Tartar from his Russian Foe By Astracan over the Snowie Plaines Retires, or Bactrian Sophi from the hornes Of Turkish Crescent, leaves all waste beyond The Realme of Aladule, in his retreate To Tauris or Casbeen. So these the late Heav\u2019n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell Many a dark League, reduc\u2019t in careful Watch Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting Each hour their great adventurer from the search Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt, In shew plebeian Angel militant Of lowest order, past; and from the dore Of that Plutonian Hall, invisible Ascended his high Throne, which under state Of richest texture spred, at th\u2019 upper end Was plac\u2019t in regal lustre. Down a while He sate, and round about him saw unseen: At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head And shape Starr bright appeer\u2019d, or brighter, clad With what permissive glory since his fall Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz\u2019d At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish\u2019d beheld, Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th\u2019 acclaime: Forth rush\u2019d in haste the great consulting Peers, Rais\u2019d from thir dark Divan, and with like joy Congratulant approach\u2019d him, who with hand Silence, and with these words attention won. Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, For in possession such, not onely of right, I call ye and declare ye now, returnd Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth Triumphant out of this infernal Pit Abominable, accurst, the house of woe, And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess, As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven Little inferiour, by my adventure hard With peril great atchiev\u2019d. Long were to tell What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine Voyag\u2019d the unreal, vast, unbounded deep Of horrible confusion, over which By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav\u2019d To expedite your glorious march; but I Toild out my uncouth passage, forc\u2019t to ride Th\u2019 untractable Abysse, plung\u2019d in the womb Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wilde, That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos\u2019d My journey strange, with clamorous uproare Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found The new created World, which fame in Heav\u2019n Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful Of absolute perfection, therein Man Plac\u2019t in a Paradise, by", "our exile Made happie: Him by fraud I have seduc\u2019d From his Creator, and the more to increase Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv\u2019n up Both his beloved Man and all his World, To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us, Without our hazard, labour or allarme, To range in, and to dwell, and over Man To rule, as over all he should have rul\u2019d. True is, mee also he hath judg\u2019d, or rather Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape Man I deceav\u2019d: that which to mee belongs, Is enmity, which he will put between Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel; His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head: A World who would not purchase with a bruise, Or much more grievous pain? Ye have th\u2019 account Of my performance: What remaines, ye Gods, But up and enter now into full bliss. So having said, a while he stood, expecting Thir universal shout and high applause To fill his eare, when contrary he hears On all sides, from innumerable tongues A dismal universal hiss, the sound Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long Had leasure, wondring at himself now more; His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare, His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining Each other, till supplanted down he fell A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone, Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power Now rul\u2019d him, punisht in the shape he sin\u2019d, According to his doom: he would have spoke, But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue To forked tongue, for now were all transform\u2019d Alike, to Serpents all as accessories To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now With complicated monsters, head and taile, Scorpion and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire, Cerastes hornd, Hydrus, and Ellops drear, And Dipsas (Not so thick swarm\u2019d once the Soil Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle Ophiusa) but still greatest hee the midst, Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun Ingenderd in the Pythian Vale on slime, Huge Python, and his Power no less he seem\u2019d Above the rest still to retain; they all Him follow\u2019d issuing forth to th\u2019 open Field, Where all yet left of that revolted Rout Heav\u2019n-fall\u2019n, in station stood or just array, Sublime with expectation when to see In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief; They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell, And horrid sympathie; for what they saw, They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms, Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast, And the dire hiss renew\u2019d, and the dire form Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment, As in thir crime. Thus was th\u2019 applause they meant, Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame Cast on themselves from thir own mouths. There stood A Grove hard by, sprung up with", "this thir change, His will who reigns above, to aggravate Thir penance, laden with fair Fruit, like that VVhich grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve Us\u2019d by the Tempter: on that prospect strange Thir earnest eyes they fix\u2019d, imagining For one forbidden Tree a multitude Now ris\u2019n, to work them furder woe or shame; Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce, Though to delude them sent, could not abstain, But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks That curld Megaera: greedily they pluck\u2019d The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew Neer that bituminous Lake where Sodom flam\u2019d; This more delusive, not the touch, but taste Deceav\u2019d; they fondly thinking to allay Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit Chewd bitter Ashes, which th\u2019 offended taste VVith spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd, Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft, VVith hatefullest disrelish writh\u2019d thir jaws VVith foot and cinders fill\u2019d; so oft they fell Into the same illusion, not as Man Whom they triumph\u2019d once lapst. Thus were they plagu\u2019d And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss, Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum\u2019d, Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo This annual humbling certain number\u2019d days, To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc\u2019t. However some tradition they dispers\u2019d Among the Heathen of thir purchase got, And Fabl\u2019d how the Serpent, whom they calld Ophion with Eurynome, the wide- Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driv\u2019n And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born. Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair Too soon arriv\u2019d, Sin there in power before, Once actual, now in body, and to dwell Habitual habitant; behind her Death Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet On his pale Horse: to whom Sin thus began. Second of Satan sprung, all conquering Death, What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd With travail difficult, not better farr Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch, Unnam\u2019d, undreaded, and thy self half starv\u2019d? Whom thus the Sin- born Monster answerd soon. To mee, who with eternal Famin pine, Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven, There best, where most with ravin I may meet; Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps. To whom th\u2019 incestuous Mother thus repli\u2019d. Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, & Flours Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle, No homely morsels, and whatever thing The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar\u2019d, Till I in Man residing through the Race, His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect, And season him thy last and sweetest prey. This said, they both betook them several wayes, Both to destroy, or unimmortal make All kinds, and for destruction to mature Sooner or later; which th\u2019 Almightie seeing, From his transcendent Seat the Saints among, To those bright Orders", "utterd thus his voice. See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance To waste and havoc yonder VVorld, which I So fair and good created, and had still Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man Let in these wastful Furies, who impute Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell And his Adherents, that with so much ease I suffer them to enter and possess A place so heav\u2019nly, and conniving seem To gratifie my scornful Enemies, That laugh, as if transported with some fit Of Passion, I to them had quitted all, At random yeilded up to their misrule; And know not that I call\u2019d and drew them thither My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed On what was pure, till cramm\u2019d and gorg\u2019d, nigh burst With suckt and glutted offal, at one fling Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son, Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave at last Through Chaos hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes. Then Heav\u2019n and Earth renewd shall be made pure To sanctitie that shall receive no staine: Till then the Curse pronounc\u2019t on both precedes. Hee ended, and the heav\u2019nly Audience loud Sung Halleluia, as the sound of Seas, Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways, Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works; Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son, Destin\u2019d restorer of Mankind, by whom New Heav\u2019n and Earth shall to the Ages rise, Or down from Heav\u2019n descend. Such was thir song, While the Creator calling forth by name His mightie Angels gave them several charge, As sorted best with present things. The Sun Had first his precept so to move, so shine, As might affect the Earth with cold and heat Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring Solstitial summers heat. To the blanc Moone Her office they prescrib\u2019d, to th\u2019 other five Thir planetarie motions and aspects In Sextile, Square, and Trine, and Opposite, Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt Thir influence malignant when to showre, Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling, Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set Thir corners, when with bluster to confound Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle With terror through the dark Aereal Hall. Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more From the Suns Axle; they with labour push\u2019d Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun Was bid turn Reines from th\u2019 Equinoctial Rode Like distant breadth to Taurus with the Seav\u2019n Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins Up to the Tropic Crab; thence down amaine By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales, As deep as Capricorne, to bring in change Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring Perpetual smil\u2019d on", "Earth with vernant Flours, Equal in Days and Nights, except to those Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun To recompence his distance, in thir sight Had rounded still th\u2019 Horizon, and not known Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow From cold Estotiland, and South as farr Beneath Magellan. At that tasted Fruit The Sun, as from Thyestean Banquet, turn\u2019d His course intended; else how had the World Inhabited, though sinless, more then now, Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate? These changes in the Heav\u2019ns, though slow, produc\u2019d Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast, Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot, Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shoar Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw, Boreas and Caecias and Argestes loud And Thrascias rend the Woods and Seas upturn; With adverse blast up-turns them from the South Notus and Afer black with thundrous Clouds From Serraliona; thwart of these as fierce Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent VVindes Eurus and Zephir with thir lateral noise, Sirocco, and Libecchio. Thus began Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first Daughter of Sin, among th\u2019 irrational, Death introduc\u2019d through fierce antipathie: Beast now with Beast gan war, & Fowle with Fowle, And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving, Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe Of Man, but fled him, or with count\u2019nance grim Glar\u2019d on him passing: these were from without The growing miseries, which Adam saw Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within, And in a troubl\u2019d Sea of passion tost, Thus to disburd\u2019n sought with sad complaint. O miserable of happie! is this the end Of this new glorious World, and mee so late The Glory of that Glory, who now becom Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face Of God, whom to behold was then my highth Of happiness: yet well, if here would end The miserie, I deserv\u2019d it, and would beare My own deservings; but this will not serve; All that I eate or drink, or shall beget, Is propagated curse. O voice once heard Delightfully, Encrease and Multiply, Now death to heare! for what can I encrease Or multiplie, but curses on my head? Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling The evil on him brought by me, will curse My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure, For this we may thank Adam; but his thanks Shall be the execration; so besides Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound, On mee as on thir natural center light Heavie, though in thir place. O fleeting joyes Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes! Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee From darkness to promote me, or here", "place In this delicious Garden? as my Will Concurd not to my being, it were but right And equal to reduce me to my dust, Desirous to resigne, and render back All I receav\u2019d, unable to performe Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold The good I sought not. To the loss of that, Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added The sense of endless woes? inexplicable Thy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late, I thus contest; then should have been refusd Those terms whatever, when they were propos\u2019d: Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good, Then cavil the conditions? and though God Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son Prove disobedient, and reprov\u2019d, retort, Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not: Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee That proud excuse? yet him not thy election, But Natural necessity begot. God made thee of choice his own, and of his own To serve him, thy reward was of his grace, Thy punishment then justly is at his Will. Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair, That dust I am, and shall to dust returne: O welcom hour whenever! why delayes His hand to execute what his Decree Fixd on this day? why do I overlive, Why am I mockt with death, and length\u2019nd out To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth Insensible, how glad would lay me down As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse To mee and to my ofspring would torment me With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt Pursues me still, least all I cannot die, Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man Which God inspir\u2019d, cannot together perish With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave, Or in some other dismal place, who knows But I shall die a living Death? O thought Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath Of Life that sinn\u2019d; what dies but what had life And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither. All of me then shall die: let this appease The doubt, since humane reach no further knows. For though the Lord of all be infinite, Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so, But mortal doom\u2019d. How can he exercise Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end? Can he make deathless Death? that were to make Strange contradiction, which to God himself Impossible is held, as Argument Of weakness, not of Power. Will he, draw out, For angers sake, finite to infinite In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour Satisfi\u2019d never; that were to extend His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law, By which all Causes else according still To the reception of thir matter act, Not to th\u2019 extent of thir own Spheare. But say That Death be not", "one stroak, as I suppos\u2019d, Bereaving sense, but endless miserie From this day onward, which I feel begun Both in me, and without me, and so last To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution On my defensless head; both Death and I Am found Eternal, and incorporate both, Nor I on my part single, in mee all Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able To waste it all my self, and leave ye none! So disinherited how would ye bless Me now your Curse! Ah, why should all mankind For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn\u2019d, If guiltless? But from mee what can proceed, But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav\u2019d, Not to do onely, but to will the same With me? how can they acquitted stand In sight of God? Him after all Disputes Forc\u2019t I absolve: all my evasions vain And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still But to my own conviction: first and last On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring Of all corruption, all the blame lights due; So might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou support That burden heavier then the Earth to bear, Then all the world much heavier, though divided With that bad Woman? Thus what thou desir\u2019st, And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable Beyond all past example and future, To Satan onely like both crime and doom. O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears And horrors hast thou driv\u2019n me; out of which I find no way, from deep to deeper plung\u2019d! Thus Adam to himself lamented loud Through the still Night, now now, as ere man fell, Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom, Which to his evil Conscience represented All things with double terror: On the ground Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft Curs\u2019d his Creation, Death as oft accus\u2019d Of tardie execution, since denounc\u2019t The day of his offence. Why comes not Death, Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word, Justice Divine not hast\u2019n to be just? But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries. O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs, VVith other echo farr I taught your Shades To answer, and resound farr other Song. VVhom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld, Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh, Soft words to his fierce passion she assay\u2019d: But her with stern regard he thus repell\u2019d. Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best Befits thee with him leagu\u2019d, thy self as false And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee Henceforth; least that too heav\u2019nly form, pretended To hellish falshood, snare them. But for", "thee I had persisted happie, had not thy pride And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe, Rejected my forewarning, and disdain\u2019d Not to be trusted, longing to be seen Though by the Devil himself, him overweening To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting Fool\u2019d and beguil\u2019d, by him thou, I by thee, To trust thee from my side, imagin\u2019d wise, Constant, mature, proof against all assaults, And understood not all was but a shew Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears, More to the part sinister from me drawn, Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie To my just number found. O why did God, Creator wise, that peopl\u2019d highest Heav\u2019n With Spirits Masculine, create at last This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect Of Nature, and not fill the World at once With Men as Angels without Feminine, Or find some other way to generate Mankind? this mischief had not then befall\u2019n, And more that shall befall, innumerable Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares, And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either He never shall find out fit Mate, but such As some misfortune brings him, or mistake, Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain Through her perverseness, but shall see her gaind By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld By Parents, or his happiest choice too late Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame: Which infinite calamitie shall cause To humane life, and houshold peace confound. He added not, and from her turn\u2019d, but Eve Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas\u2019d not flowing, And tresses all disorderd, at his feet Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint. Forsake me not thus, Adam, witness Heav\u2019n What love sincere, and reverence in my heart I beare thee, and unweeting have offended, Unhappilie deceav\u2019d; thy suppliant I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, Thy counsel in this uttermost distress, My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee, Whither shall I betake me, where subsist? While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps, Between us two let there be peace, both joyning, As joyn\u2019d in injuries, one enmitie Against a Foe by doom express assign\u2019d us, That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not Thy hatred for this miserie befall\u2019n, On me already lost, mee then thy self More miserable; both have sin\u2019d, but thou Against God onely, I against God and thee, And to the place of judgement will return, There with my cries importune Heaven, that all The sentence from thy head remov\u2019d may light On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe, Mee mee onely just object of his ire. She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight, Immoveable till peace obtain\u2019d from fault Acknowledg\u2019d and deplor\u2019d, in Adam wraught Commiseration; soon his heart relented Towards her, his life so late and sole", "delight, Now at his feet submissive in distress, Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking, His counsel whom she had displeas\u2019d, his aide; As one disarm\u2019d, his anger all he lost, And thus with peaceful words uprais\u2019d her soon. Unwarie, and too desirous, as before, So now of what thou knowst not, who desir\u2019st The punishment all on thy self; alas, Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part, And my displeasure bearst so ill. If Prayers Could alter high Decrees, I to that place Would speed before thee, and be louder heard, That on my head all might be visited, Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv\u2019n, To me committed and by me expos\u2019d. But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame Each other, blam\u2019d enough elsewhere, but strive In offices of Love, how we may light\u2019n Each others burden in our share of woe; Since this days Death denounc\u2019t, if ought I see, Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac\u2019t evill, A long days dying to augment our paine, And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv\u2019d. To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, repli\u2019d. Adam, by sad experiment I know How little weight my words with thee can finde, Found so erroneous, thence by just event Found so unfortunate; nevertheless, Restor\u2019d by thee, vile as I am, to place Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart, Living or dying from thee I will not hide What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris\u2019n, Tending to som relief of our extremes, Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable, As in our evils, and of easier choice. If care of our descent perplex us most, Which must be born to certain woe, devourd By Death at last, and miserable it is To be to others cause of misery, Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring Into this cursed World a woful Race, That after wretched Life must be at last Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot. Childless thou art, Childless remaine: So Death shall be deceav\u2019d his glut, and with us two Be forc\u2019d to satisfie his Rav\u2019nous Maw. But if thou judge it hard and difficult, Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain From Loves due Rites, Nuptial embraces sweet, And with desire to languish without hope, Before the present object languishing With like desire, which would be miserie And torment less then none of what we dread, Then both our selves and Seed at once to free From what we fear for both, let us make short, Let us seek Death, or hee not found, supply With our own hands his Office on our selves; Why stand we longer shivering under feares, That shew no end but Death, and have the power, Of many wayes to die the shortest choosing, Destruction with destruction to", "destroy. She ended heer, or vehement despaire Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts Had entertaind, as di\u2019d her Cheeks with pale. But Adam with such counsel nothing sway\u2019d, To better hopes his more attentive minde Labouring had rais\u2019d, and thus to Eve repli\u2019d. Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems To argue in thee somthing more sublime And excellent then what thy minde contemnes; But self- destruction therefore saught, refutes That excellence thought in thee, and implies, Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret For loss of life and pleasure overlov\u2019d. Or if thou covet death, as utmost end Of miserie, so thinking to evade The penaltie pronounc\u2019t, doubt not but God Hath wiselier arm\u2019d his vengeful ire then so To be forestall\u2019d; much more I fear least Death So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine We are by doom to pay; rather such acts Of contumacie will provoke the highest To make death in us live: Then let us seek Som safer resolution, which methinks I have in view, calling to minde with heed Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe Satan, who in the Serpent hath contriv\u2019d Against us this deceit: to crush his head Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost By death brought on our selves, or childless days Resolv\u2019d, as thou proposest; so our Foe Shall scape his punishment ordain\u2019d, and wee Instead shall double ours upon our heads. No more be mention\u2019d then of violence Against our selves, and wilful barrenness, That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely Rancor and pride, impatience and despite, Reluctance against God and his just yoke Laid on our Necks. Remember with what mild And gracious temper he both heard and judg\u2019d Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected Immediate dissolution, which we thought Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold, And bringing forth, soon recompenc\u2019t with joy, Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope Glanc\u2019d on the ground, with labour I must earne My bread; what harm? Idleness had bin worse; My labour will sustain me; and least Cold Or Heat should injure us, his timely care Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands Cloath\u2019d us unworthie, pitying while he judg\u2019d; How much more, if we pray him, will his ear Be open, and his heart to pitie incline, And teach us further by what means to shun Th\u2019 inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow, Which now the Skie with various Face begins To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish Our Limbs benumm\u2019d, ere this diurnal Starr Leave cold the Night, how we his gather\u2019d beams Reflected, may with matter sere foment, Or by collision", "of two bodies grinde The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv\u2019n down Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine, And sends a comfortable heat from farr, Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use, And what may else be remedie or cure To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought, Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace Beseeching him, so as we need not fear To pass commodiously this life, sustain\u2019d By him with many comforts, till we end In dust, our final rest and native home. What better can we do, then to the place Repairing where he judg\u2019d us, prostrate fall Before him reverent, and there confess Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears VVatering the ground, and with our sighs the Air Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign Of sorrow unfeign\u2019d, and humiliation meek. Undoubtedly he will relent and turn From his displeasure; in whose look serene, VVhen angry most he seem\u2019d and most severe, VVhat else but favor, grace, and mercie shon? So spake our Father penitent, nor Eve Felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place Repairing where he judg\u2019d them prostrate fell Before him reverent, and both confess\u2019d Humbly thir faults, and pardon beg\u2019d, with tears VVatering the ground, and with thir sighs the Air Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign Of sorrow unfeign\u2019d, and humiliation meek. THE END OF THE NINTH BOOK. PARADISE LOST. BOOK X. Thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood Praying, for from the Mercie-seat above Prevenient Grace descending had remov\u2019d The stonie from thir hearts, and made new flesh Regenerat grow instead, that sighs now breath\u2019d Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer Inspir\u2019d, and wing\u2019d for Heav\u2019n with speedier flight Then loudest Oratorie: yet thir port Not of mean suiters, nor important less Seem\u2019d thir Petition, then when th\u2019 ancient Pair In Fables old, less ancient yet then these, Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha to restore The Race of Mankind drownd, before the Shrine Of Themis stood devout. To Heav\u2019n thir prayers Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious windes Blow\u2019n vagabond or frustrate: in they passd Dimentionless through Heav\u2019nly dores; then clad With incense, where the Golden Altar fum\u2019d, By thir great Intercessor, came in sight Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son Presenting, thus to intercede began. See Father, what first fruits on Earth are sprung From thy implanted Grace in Man, these Sighs And Prayers, which in this Golden Censer, mixt With Incense, I thy Priest before thee bring, Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed Sow\u2019n with contrition in his heart, then those Which his own hand manuring all the Trees Of Paradise could have produc\u2019t, ere fall\u2019n From innocence. Now therefore bend thine eare To supplication, heare his sighs though mute; Unskilful with what words to pray, let mee Interpret for him, mee his Advocate And propitiation,", "all his works on mee Good or not good ingraft, my Merit those Shall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay. Accept me, and in mee from these receave The smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him live Before thee reconcil\u2019d, at least his days Numberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which I To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse) To better life shall yeeld him, where with mee All my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss, Made one with me as I with thee am one. To whom the Father, without Cloud, serene. All thy request for Man, accepted Son, Obtain, all thy request was my Decree: But longer in that Paradise to dwell, The Law I gave to Nature him forbids: Those pure immortal Elements that know No gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule, Eject him tainted now, and purge him off As a distemper, gross to aire as gross, And mortal food, as may dispose him best For dissolution wrought by Sin, that first Distemperd all things, and of incorrupt Corrupted. I at first with two fair gifts Created him endowd, with Happiness And Immortalitie: that fondly lost, This other serv\u2019d but to eternize woe; Till I provided Death; so Death becomes His final remedie, and after Life Tri\u2019d in sharp tribulation, and refin\u2019d By Faith and faithful works, to second Life, Wak\u2019t in the renovation of the just, Resignes him up with Heav\u2019n and Earth renewd. But let us call to Synod all the Blest Through Heav\u2019ns wide bounds; from them I will not hide My judgments, how with Mankind I proceed, As how with peccant Angels late they saw; And in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd. He ended, and the Son gave signal high To the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew His Trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps When God descended, and perhaps once more To sound at general Doom. Th\u2019 Angelic blast Filld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs Of Amarantin Shade, Fountain or Spring, By the waters of Life, where ere they sate In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light Hasted, resorting to the Summons high, And took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream Th\u2019 Almighty thus pronounced his sovran Will. O Sons, like one of us Man is become To know both Good and Evil, since his taste Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast His knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got, Happier, had it suffic\u2019d him to have known Good by it self, and Evil not at all. He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite, My motions in him, longer then they move, His heart I know, how variable and vain Self-left. Least therefore his now bolder hand Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat, And live for ever, dream at least to live Forever, to remove him I decree, And send him from the Garden forth to Till The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile. Michael, this", "my behest have thou in charge, Take to thee from among the Cherubim Thy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend Or in behalf of Man, or to invade Vacant possession som new trouble raise: Hast thee, and from the Paradise of God Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair, From hallowd ground th\u2019 unholie, and denounce To them and to thir Progenie from thence Perpetual banishment. Yet least they faint At the sad Sentence rigorously urg\u2019d, For I behold them soft\u2019nd and with tears Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide. If patiently thy bidding they obey, Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale To Adam what shall come in future dayes, As I shall thee enlighten, intermix My Cov\u2019nant in the Womans seed renewd; So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace: And on the East side of the Garden place, Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbes, Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright, And guard all passage to the Tree of Life: Least Paradise a receptacle prove To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey, With whose stol\u2019n Fruit Man once more to delude. He ceas\u2019d; and th\u2019 Archangelic Power prepar\u2019d For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each Had, like a double Janus, all thir shape Spangl\u2019d with eyes more numerous then those Of Argus, and more wakeful then to drouze, Charm\u2019d with Arcadian Pipe, the Pastoral Reed Of Hermes, or his opiate Rod. Meanwhile To resalute the World with sacred Light Leucothea wak\u2019d, and with fresh dews imbalmd The Earth, when Adam and first Matron Eve Had ended now thir Orisons, and found, Strength added from above, new hope to spring Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt; Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewd. Eve, easily may Faith admit, that all The good which we enjoy, from Heav\u2019n descends But that from us ought should ascend to Heav\u2019n So prevalent as to concerne the mind Of God high blest, or to incline his will, Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer, Or one short sigh of humane breath, up- borne Ev\u2019n to the Seat of God. For since I saught By Prayer th\u2019 offended Deitie to appease, Kneel\u2019d and before him humbl\u2019d all my heart, Methought I saw him placable and mild, Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew That I was heard with favour; peace returnd Home to my brest, and to my memorie His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe; Which then not minded in dismay, yet now Assures me that the bitterness of death Is past, and we shall live. Whence Haile to thee, Eve rightly call\u2019d, Mother of all Mankind, Mother of all things living, since by thee Man is to live, and all things live for Man. To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek. Ill worthie I such title should belong To me transgressour, who for", "thee ordaind A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise: But infinite in pardon was my Judge, That I who first brought Death on all, am grac\u2019t The sourse of life; next favourable thou, Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf\u2019t, Farr other name deserving. But the Field To labour calls us now with sweat impos\u2019d, Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn, All unconcern\u2019d with our unrest, begins Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth, I never from thy side henceforth to stray, Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell, What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes? Here let us live, though in fall\u2019n state, content. So spake, so wish\u2019d much-humbl\u2019d Eve, but Fate Subscrib\u2019d not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips\u2019d After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight The Bird of Jove, stoopt from his aerie tour, Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove: Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods, First Hunter then, pursu\u2019d a gentle brace, Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde; Direct to th\u2019 Eastern Gate was bent thir flight. Adam observ\u2019d, and with his Eye the chase Pursuing, not unmov\u2019d to Eve thus spake. O Eve, some furder change awaits us nigh, Which Heav\u2019n by these mute signs in Nature shews Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn Us haply too secure of our discharge From penaltie, because from death releast Some days; how long, and what till then our life, Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust, And thither must return and be no more. VVhy else this double object in our sight Of flight pursu\u2019d in th\u2019 Air and ore the ground One way the self-same hour? why in the East Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light More orient in yon VVestern Cloud that draws O\u2019re the blew Firmament a radiant white, And slow descends, with somthing heav\u2019nly fraught. He err\u2019d not, for by this the heav\u2019nly Bands Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt, A glorious Apparition, had not doubt And carnal fear that day dimm\u2019d Adams eye. Not that more glorious, when the Angels met Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw The field Pavilion\u2019d with his Guardians bright; Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd In Dothan, cover\u2019d with a Camp of Fire, Against the Syrian King, who to surprize One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr, Warr unproclam\u2019d. The Princely Hierarch In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise Possession of the Garden; hee alone, To finde where Adam shelterd, took his way, Not unperceav\u2019d of Adam, who to Eve, While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake. Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps Of us will soon determin, or impose New Laws to be observ\u2019d; for I descrie From yonder blazing Cloud", "that veils the Hill One of the heav\u2019nly Host, and by his Gate None of the meanest, some great Potentate Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie Invests him coming; yet not terrible, That I should fear, nor sociably mild, As Raphael, that I should much confide, But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend, With reverence I must meet, and thou retire. He ended; and th\u2019 Arch-Angel soon drew nigh, Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes A militarie Vest of purple flowd Livelier then Meliboean, or the graine Of Sarra, worn by Kings and Hero\u2019s old In time of Truce; Iris had dipt the wooff; His starrie Helme unbuckl\u2019d shew\u2019d him prime In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side As in a glistering Zodiac hung the Sword, Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear. Adam bowd low, hee Kingly from his State Inclin\u2019d not, but his coming thus declar\u2019d. Adam, Heav\u2019ns high behest no Preface needs: Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death, Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress, Defeated of his seisure many dayes Giv\u2019n thee of Grace, wherein thou may\u2019st repent, And one bad act with many deeds well done Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas\u2019d Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes; But longer in this Paradise to dwell Permits not; to remove thee I am come, And send thee from the Garden forth to till The ground whence thou wast tak\u2019n, fitter Soile. He added not, for Adam at the newes Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood, That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen Yet all had heard, with audible lament Discover\u2019d soon the place of her retire. O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death! Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades, Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend, Quiet though sad, the respit of that day That must be mortal to us both. O flours, That never will in other Climate grow, My early visitation, and my last At Eev\u2019n, which I bred up with tender hand From the first op\u2019ning bud, and gave ye Names, Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke Your Tribes, and water from th\u2019 ambrosial Fount? Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee How shall I part, and whither wander down Into a lower World, to this obscure And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits? Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde. Lament not Eve, but patiently resigne What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart, Thus over fond, on that which is not thine; Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound; Where he abides, think there thy native soile. Adam by this from the cold sudden", "damp Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd, To Michael thus his humble words addressd. Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam\u2019d Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould Thy message, which might else in telling wound, And in performing end us; what besides Of sorrow and dejection and despair Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring, Departure from this happy place, our sweet Recess, and onely consolation left Familiar to our eyes, all places else Inhospitable appeer and desolate, Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer Incessant I could hope to change the will Of him who all things can, I would not cease To wearie him with my assiduous cries: But prayer against his absolute Decree No more availes then breath against the winde, Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth: Therefore to his great bidding I submit. This most afflicts me, that departing hence, As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd His blessed count\u2019nance; here I could frequent, With worship, place by place where he voutsaf\u2019d Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate; On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree Stood visible, among these Pines his voice I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk\u2019d: So many grateful Altars I would reare Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone Of lustre from the brook, in memorie, Or monument to Ages, and thereon Offer sweet smelling Gumms & Fruits and Flours: In yonder nether World where shall I seek His bright appearances, or footstep trace? For though I fled him angrie, yet recall\u2019d To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts Of glory, and farr off his steps adore. To whom thus Michael with regard benigne. Adam, thou know\u2019st Heav\u2019n his, and all the Earth Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives, Fomented by his virtual power and warmd: All th\u2019 Earth he gave thee to possess and rule, No despicable gift; surmise not then His presence to these narrow bounds confin\u2019d Of Paradise or Eden: this had been Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred All generations, and had hither come From all the ends of th\u2019 Earth, to celebrate And reverence thee thir great Progenitor. But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons: Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine God is as here, and will be found alike Present, and of his presence many a signe Still following thee, still compassing thee round With goodness and paternal Love, his Face Express, and of his steps the track Divine. Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd, Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent To shew thee what shall come in future dayes To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending", "With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn True patience, and to temper joy with fear And pious sorrow, equally enur\u2019d By moderation either state to beare, Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead Safest thy life, and best prepar\u2019d endure Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend This Hill; let Eve (for I have drencht her eyes) Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak\u2019st, As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd. To whom thus Adam gratefully repli\u2019d. Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path Thou lead\u2019st me, and to the hand of Heav\u2019n submit, However chast\u2019ning, to the evil turne My obvious breast, arming to overcom By suffering, and earne rest from labour won, If so I may attain. So both ascend In the Visions of God: It was a Hill Of Paradise the highest, from whose top The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay. Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round, Whereon for different cause the Tempter set Our second Adam in the Wilderness, To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory. His Eye might there command wherever stood City of old or modern Fame, the Seat Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne, To Paquin of Sinaean Kings, and thence To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul Down to the golden Chersones, or where The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance, Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken Th\u2019 Empire of Negus to his utmost Port Ercoco and the less Maritine Kings Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind, And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realme Of Congo, and Angola fardest South; Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez, and Sus, Marocco and Algiers, and Tremisen; On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway The VVorld: in Spirit perhaps he also saw Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume, And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoil\u2019d Guiana, whose great Citie Geryons Sons Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights Michael from Adams eyes the Filme remov\u2019d VVhich that false Fruit that promis\u2019d clearer sight Had bred; then purg\u2019d with Euphrasie and Rue The visual Nerve, for he had much to see; And from the VVell of Life three drops instill\u2019d. So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc\u2019d, Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight, That Adam now enforc\u2019t to close his eyes, Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst: But him the gentle Angel by the hand Soon rais\u2019d, and his attention thus recall\u2019d. Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold Th\u2019 effects which thy original crime hath wrought In some to spring from thee, who never touch\u2019d Th\u2019 excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir\u2019d, Nor sinn\u2019d thy sin, yet from that sin", "derive Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds. His eyes he op\u2019nd, and beheld a field, Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds; Ith\u2019 midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf, Uncull\u2019d, as came to hand; a Shepherd next More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew\u2019d, On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform\u2019d. His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav\u2019n Consum\u2019d with nimble glance, and grateful steame; The others not, for his was not sincere; Whereat hee inlie rag\u2019d, and as they talk\u2019d, Smote him into the Midriff with a stone That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus\u2019d. Much at that sight was Adam in his heart Dismai\u2019d, and thus in haste to th\u2019 Angel cri\u2019d. O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall\u2019n To that meek man, who well had sacrific\u2019d; Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid? T\u2019 whom Michael thus, hee also mov\u2019d, repli\u2019d. These two are Brethren, Adam, and to come Out of thy loyns; th\u2019 unjust the just hath slain, For envie that his Brothers Offering found From Heav\u2019n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact Will be aveng\u2019d, and th\u2019 others Faith approv\u2019d Loose no reward, though here thou see him die, Rowling in dust and gore. To which our Sire. Alas, both for the deed and for the cause! But have I now seen Death? Is this the way I must return to native dust? O sight Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen In his first shape on man; but many shapes Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense More terrible at th\u2019 entrance then within. Some, as thou saw\u2019st, by violent stroke shall die, By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know What miserie th\u2019 inabstinence of Eve Shall bring on men. Immediately a place Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark, A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid Numbers of all diseas\u2019d, all maladies Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds, Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs, Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs, Dropsies, and Asthma\u2019s, and Joint-racking Rheums. Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch; And over them triumphant Death his Dart Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok\u2019t With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope. Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long Drie-ey\u2019d behold? Adam", "could not, but wept, Though not of Woman born; compassion quell\u2019d His best of Man, and gave him up to tears A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess, And scarce recovering words his plaint renew\u2019d. O miserable Mankind, to what fall Degraded, to what wretched state reserv\u2019d? Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv\u2019n To be thus wrested from us? rather why Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew What we receive, would either not accept Life offer\u2019d, or soon beg to lay it down, Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus Th\u2019 Image of God in man created once So goodly and erect, though faultie since, To such unsightly sufferings be debas\u2019t Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man, Retaining still Divine similitude In part, from such deformities be free, And for his Makers Image sake exempt? Thir Makers Image, answerd Michael, then Forsook them, when themselves they villifi\u2019d To serve ungovern\u2019d appetite, and took His Image whom they serv\u2019d, a brutish vice, Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. Therefore so abject is thir punishment, Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own, Or if his likeness, by themselves defac\u2019t While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they Gods Image did not reverence in themselves. I yeild it just, said Adam, and submit. But is there yet no other way, besides These painful passages, how we may come To Death, and mix with our connatural dust? There is, said Michael, if thou well observe The rule of not too much, by temperance taught In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, Till many years over thy head return: So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature: This is old age; but then thou must outlive Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change To witherd weak & gray; thy Senses then Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe, To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne A melancholly damp of cold and dry To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume The Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor. Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong Life much, bent rather how I may be quit Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge, Which I must keep till my appointed day Of rendring up. Michael to him repli\u2019d. Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst Live well, how long or short permit to Heav\u2019n: And now prepare thee for another sight. He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound Of Instruments that made melodious chime Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch Instinct through all proportions", "low and high Fled and pursu\u2019d transverse the resonant fugue. In other part stood one who at the Forge Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass Had melted (whether found where casual fire Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale, Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind Into fit moulds prepar\u2019d; from which he formd First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought Fulfil or grav\u2019n in mettle. After these, But on the hether side a different sort From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat, Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent To worship God aright, and know his works Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on: The Men though grave, ey\u2019d them, and let thir eyes Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net Fast caught, they lik\u2019d, and each his liking chose; And now of love they treat till th\u2019 Eevning Star Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok\u2019t; With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound. Such happy interview and fair event Of love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours, And charming Symphonies attach\u2019d the heart Of Adam, soon enclin\u2019d to admit delight, The bent of Nature; which he thus express\u2019d. True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest, Much better seems this Vision, and more hope Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past; Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse, Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet, Created, as thou art, to nobler end Holie and pure, conformitie divine. Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race Who slew his Brother; studious they appere Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare, Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg\u2019d none. Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget; For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, Yet empty of all good wherein consists Womans domestic honour and chief praise; Bred onely and completed to the taste Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance, To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye. To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives Religious titl\u2019d them the Sons of God, Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles Of these", "fair Atheists, and now swim in joy, (Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which The world erelong a world of tears must weepe. To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft. O pittie and shame, that they who to live well Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! But still I see the tenor of Mans woe Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. From Mans effeminate slackness it begins, Said th\u2019 Angel, who should better hold his place By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd. But now prepare thee for another Scene. He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred Before him, Towns, and rural works between, Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs, Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr, Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise; Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed, Single or in Array of Battel rang\u2019d Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood; One way a Band select from forage drives A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock, Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine, Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye, But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray; With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine; Where Cattel pastur\u2019d late, now scatterd lies With Carcasses and Arms th\u2019 ensanguind Field Deserted: Others to a Citie strong Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine, Assaulting; others from the Wall defend With Dart and Jav\u2019lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire; On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. In other part the scepter\u2019d Haralds call To Council in the Citie Gates: anon Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt, Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon In factious opposition, till at last Of middle Age one rising, eminent In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong, Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace, And Judgement from above: him old and young Exploded, and had seiz\u2019d with violent hands, Had not a Cloud descending snatch\u2019d him thence Unseen amid the throng: so violence Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found. Adam was all in tears, and to his guide Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these, Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death Inhumanly to men, and multiply Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew His Brother; for of whom such massacher Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men? But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav\u2019n Rescu\u2019d, had in his Righteousness bin lost? To whom thus Michael; These are the product Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw\u2019st; Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt, Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind. Such were these Giants, men of high renown; For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir\u2019d, And Valour and Heroic Vertu call\u2019d;", "To overcome in Battel, and subdue Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done Of triumph, to be styl\u2019d great Conquerours, Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods, Destroyers rightlier call\u2019d and Plagues of men. Thus Fame shall be achiev\u2019d, renown on Earth, And what most merits fame in silence hid. But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst The onely righteous in a World perverse, And therefore hated, therefore so beset With Foes for daring single to be just, And utter odious Truth, that God would come To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss, Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward Awaits the good, the rest what punishment; Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. He look\u2019d, & saw the face of things quite chang\u2019d; The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar, All now was turn\u2019d to jollitie and game, To luxurie and riot, feast and dance, Marrying or prostituting, as befell, Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles. At length a Reverend Sire among them came, And of thir doings great dislike declar\u2019d, And testifi\u2019d against thir wayes; hee oft Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met, Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls In prison under Judgements imminent: But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas\u2019d Contending, and remov\u2019d his Tents farr off; Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall, Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk, Measur\u2019d by Cubit, length, & breadth, and highth, Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore Contriv\u2019d, and of provisions laid in large For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange! Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore. Meanwhile the Southwind rose, & with black wings Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove From under Heav\u2019n; the Hills to their supplie Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist, Sent up amain; and now the thick\u2019nd Skie Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush\u2019d the Rain Impetuous, and continu\u2019d till the Earth No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow Rode tilting o\u2019re the Waves, all dwellings else Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp Deep under water rould; Sea cover\u2019d Sea, Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces Where luxurie late reign\u2019d, Sea-monsters whelp\u2019d And stabl\u2019d; of Mankind, so numerous late, All left, in one small bottom swum imbark\u2019t. How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad, Depopulation; thee another Floud, Of", "tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown\u2019d, And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard By th\u2019 Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last, Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns His Childern, all in view destroyd at once; And scarce to th\u2019 Angel utterdst thus thy plaint. O Visions ill foreseen! better had I Liv\u2019d ignorant of future, so had borne My part of evil onely, each dayes lot Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst The burd\u2019n of many Ages, on me light At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth Abortive, to torment me ere thir being, With thought that they must be. Let no man seek Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure, Which neither his foreknowing can prevent, And hee the future evil shall no less In apprehension then in substance feel Grievous to bear: but that care now is past, Man is not whom to warne: those few escap\u2019t Famin and anguish will at last consume Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope When violence was ceas\u2019t, and Warr on Earth, All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd With length of happy days the race of man; But I was farr deceav\u2019d; for now I see Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste. How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide, And whether here the Race of man will end. To whom thus Michael. Those whom last thou sawst In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they First seen in acts of prowess eminent And great exploits, but of true vertu void; Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey, Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth, Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace. The conquerd also, and enslav\u2019d by Warr Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose And feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign\u2019d In sharp contest of Battel found no aide Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure, Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords Shall leave them to enjoy; for th\u2019 Earth shall bear More then anough, that temperance may be tri\u2019d: So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav\u2019d, Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot; One Man except, the onely Son of light In a dark Age, against example good, Against allurement, custom, and a World Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn, Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes Shall them admonish, and before them set The paths of righteousness, how much more safe, And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come On thir impenitence; and shall returne Of them derided, but of God observd The one just Man alive; by his command Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst, To save himself and houshold from amidst A World devote", "to universal rack. No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg\u2019d, And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts Of Heav\u2019n set open on the Earth shall powre Raine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud, With all his verdure spoil\u2019d, and Trees adrift Down the great River to the op\u2019ning Gulf, And there take root an Iland salt and bare, The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang. To teach thee that God attributes to place No sanctitie, if none be thither brought By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell. And now what further shall ensue, behold. He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud, Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled, Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie Wrinkl\u2019d the face of Deluge, as decai\u2019d; And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass Gaz\u2019d hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew, As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt His Sluces, as the Heav\u2019n his windows shut. The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt. And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer; With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde. Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies, And after him, the surer messenger, A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light; The second time returning, in his Bill An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe: Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke The ancient Sire descends with all his Train; Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout, Grateful to Heav\u2019n, over his head beholds A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay, Betok\u2019ning peace from God, and Cov\u2019nant new. Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad Greatly rejoyc\u2019d, and thus his joy broke forth. O thou that future things canst represent As present, Heav\u2019nly instructer, I revive At this last sight, assur\u2019d that Man shall live With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve. Farr less I now lament for one whole World Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce For one Man found so perfet and so just, That God voutsafes to raise another World From him, and all his anger to forget. But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn, Distended as the Brow of God appeas\u2019d, Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud, Least it again dissolve and showr the", "Earth? To whom th\u2019 Archangel. Dextrously thou aim\u2019st; So willingly doth God remit his Ire, Though late repenting him of Man deprav\u2019d, Griev\u2019d at his heart, when looking down he saw The whole Earth fill\u2019d with violence, and all flesh Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov\u2019d, Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight, That he relents, not to blot out mankind, And makes a Covenant never to destroy The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set His triple-colour\u2019d Bow, whereon to look And call to mind his Cov\u2019nant: Day and Night, Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new, Both Heav\u2019n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell. Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end; And Man as from a second stock proceed. Much thou hast yet to see, but I perceave Thy mortal sight to faile; objects divine Must needs impaire and wearie human sense: Henceforth what is to com I will relate, Thou therefore give due audience, and attend. This second sours of Men, while yet but few, And while the dread of judgement past remains Fresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie, With some regard to what is just and right Shall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace, Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop, Corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock, Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid, With large Wine- offerings pour\u2019d, and sacred Feast Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam\u2019d, and dwell Long time in peace by Families and Tribes Under paternal rule; till one shall rise Of proud ambitious heart, who not content With fair equalitie, fraternal state, Will arrogate Dominion undeserv\u2019d Over his brethren, and quite dispossess Concord and law of Nature from the Earth; Hunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game) With Warr and hostile snare such as refuse Subjection to his Empire tyrannous: A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styl\u2019d Before the Lord, as in despite of Heav\u2019n, Or from Heav\u2019n claming second Sovrantie; And from Rebellion shall derive his name, Though of Rebellion others he accuse. Hee with a crew, whom like Ambition joyns With him or under him to tyrannize, Marching from Eden towards the West, shall finde The Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge Boiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell; Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build A Citie & Towre, whose top may reach to Heav\u2019n; And get themselves a name, least far disperst In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost, Regardless whether good or evil fame. But God who oft descends to visit men Unseen, and through thir habitations walks To mark thir doings, them beholding soon, Comes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower Obstruct Heav\u2019n Towrs, and", "in derision sets Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase Quite out thir Native Language, and instead To sow a jangling noise of words unknown: Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud Among the Builders; each to other calls Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage, As mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heav\u2019n And looking down, to see the hubbub strange And hear the din; thus was the building left Ridiculous, and the work Confusion nam\u2019d. Whereto thus Adam fatherly displeas\u2019d. O execrable Son so to aspire Above his Brethren, to himself affirming Authoritie usurpt, from God not giv\u2019n: He gave us onely over Beast, Fish, Fowl Dominion absolute; that right we hold By his donation; but Man over men He made not Lord; such title to himself Reserving, human left from human free. But this Usurper his encroachment proud Stayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food Will he convey up thither to sustain Himself and his rash Armie, where thin Aire Above the Clouds will pine his entrails gross, And famish him of Breath, if not of Bread? To whom thus Michael. Justly thou abhorr\u2019st That Son, who on the quiet state of men Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue Rational Libertie; yet know withall, Since thy original lapse, true Libertie Is lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwells Twinn\u2019d, and from her hath no dividual being: Reason in man obscur\u2019d, or not obeyd, Immediately inordinate desires And upstart Passions catch the Government From Reason, and to servitude reduce Man till then free. Therefore since hee permits Within himself unworthie Powers to reign Over free Reason, God in Judgement just Subjects him from without to violent Lords; Who oft as undeservedly enthrall His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be, Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse. Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong, But Justice, and some fatal curse annext Deprives them of thir outward libertie, Thir inward lost: Witness th\u2019 irreverent Son Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse, Servant of Servants, on his vitious Race. Thus will this latter, as the former World, Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw His presence from among them, and avert His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth To leave them to thir own polluted wayes; And one peculiar Nation to select From all the rest, of whom to be invok\u2019d, A Nation from one faithful man to spring: Him on this side Euphrates yet residing, Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men (Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown, While yet the Patriark liv\u2019d, who scap\u2019d the Flood, As to forsake the living God, and fall To-worship thir own work in Wood and Stone For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes To call by Vision from his Fathers house, His", "kindred and false Gods, into a Land Which he will shew him, and from him will raise A mightie Nation, and upon him showre His benediction so, that in his Seed All Nations shall be blest; hee straight obeys, Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes: I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile Ur of Chaldaea, passing now the Ford To Haran, after him a cumbrous Train Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude; Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth With God, who call\u2019d him, in a land unknown. Canaan he now attains, I see his Tents Pitcht about Sechem, and the neighbouring Plaine Of Moreb there by promise he receaves Gift to his Progenie of all that Land; From Hamath Northward to the Desert South (Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam\u2019d) From Hermon East to the great Western Sea, Mount Hermon, yonder Sea, each place behold In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare Mount Carmel; here the double-founted stream Jordan, true limit Eastward; but his Sons Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of Hills. This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon Plainlier shall be reveald. This Patriarch blest, Whom Faithful Abraham due time shall call, A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves, Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown; The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs From Canaan, to a Land hereafter call\u2019d Egypt, divided by the River Nile; See where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land He comes invited by a yonger Son In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds Raise him to be the second in that Realme Of Pharao: there he dies, and leaves his Race Growing into a Nation, and now grown Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks To stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males: Till by two brethren (those two brethren call Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claime His people from enthralment, they return With glory and spoile back to thir promis\u2019d Land. But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies To know thir God, or message to regard, Must be compelld by Signes and Judgements dire; To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd, Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill With loath\u2019d intrusion, and fill all the land; His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die, Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss, And all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile, Haile mixt with fire must rend th\u2019 Egyptian Skie And wheel on th\u2019 Earth, devouring where it rouls; What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine, A darksom Cloud of Locusts", "swarming down Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green: Darkness must overshadow all his bounds, Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes; Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born Of Egypt must lie dead. Thus with ten wounds This River-dragon tam\u2019d at length submits To let his sojourners depart, and oft Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice More hard\u2019nd after thaw, till in his rage Pursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass As on drie land between two christal walls, Aw\u2019d by the rod of Moses so to stand Divided, till his rescu\u2019d gain thir shoar: Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend, Though present in his Angel, who shall goe Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire, To guide them in thir journey, and remove Behinde them, while th\u2019 obdurat King pursues: All night he will pursue, but his approach Darkness defends between till morning Watch; Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud God looking forth will trouble all his Host And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command Moses once more his potent Rod extends Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys; On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return, And overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect Safe towards Canaan from the shoar advance Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way, Least entring on the Canaanite allarmd Warr terrifie them inexpert, and feare Return them back to Egypt, choosing rather Inglorious life with servitude; for life To noble and ignoble is more sweet Untraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on. This also shall they gain by thir delay In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found Thir government, and thir great Senate choose Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind: God from the Mount of Sinai, whose gray top Shall tremble, he descending, will himself In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine To civil Justice, part religious Rites Of sacrifice, informing them, by types And shadowes, of that destind Seed to bruise The Serpent, by what meanes he shall achieve Mankinds deliverance. But the voice of God To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech That Moses might report to them his will, And terror cease; he grants them thir desire, Instructed that to God is no access Without Mediator, whose high Office now Moses in figure beares, to introduce One greater, of whose day he shall foretell, And all the Prophets in thir Age the times Of great Messiah shall sing. Thus Laws and Rites Establisht, such delight hath God in Men Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes Among them to set up his Tabernacle, The holy One with mortal Men to dwell: By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram\u2019d Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony, The Records of his Cov\u2019nant, over these A Mercie-seat of Gold between the", "wings Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing The Heav\u2019nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud Shall rest by Day, a fierie gleame by Night, Save when they journie, and at length they come, Conducted by his Angel to the Land Promisd to Abraham and his Seed: the rest Were long to tell, how many Battels fought, How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won, Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav\u2019n stand still A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne, Mans voice commanding, Sun in Gibeon stand, And thou Moon in the vale of Aialon, Till Israel overcome; so call the third From Abraham, Son of Isaac, and from him His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win. Here Adam interpos\u2019d. O sent from Heav\u2019n, Enlightner of my darkness, gracious things Thou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne Just Abraham and his Seed: now first I finde Mine eyes true op\u2019ning, and my heart much eas\u2019d, Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom Of mee and all Mankind; but now I see His day, in whom all Nations shall be blest, Favour unmerited by me, who sought Forbidd\u2019n knowledge by forbidd\u2019n means. This yet I apprehend not, why to those Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth So many and so various Laws are giv\u2019n; So many Laws argue so many sins Among them; how can God with such reside? To whom thus Michael. Doubt not but that sin Will reign among them, as of thee begot; And therefore was Law given them to evince Thir natural pravitie, by stirring up Sin against Law to fight; that when they see Law can discover sin, but not remove, Save by those shadowie expiations weak, The bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude Some bloud more precious must be paid for Man, Just for unjust, that in such righteousness To them by Faith imputed, they may finde Justification towards God, and peace Of Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part Perform, and not performing cannot live. So Law appears imperfet, and but giv\u2019n With purpose to resign them in full time Up to a better Cov\u2019nant, disciplin\u2019d From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit, From imposition of strict Laws, to free Acceptance of large Grace, from servil fear To filial, works of Law to works of Faith. And therefore shall not Moses, though of God Highly belov\u2019d, being but the Minister Of Law, his people into Canaan lead; But Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call, His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell The adversarie Serpent, and bring back Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man Safe to eternal Paradise of rest. Meanwhile they in thir earthly Canaan plac\u2019t Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins National interrupt thir public peace, Provoking God to raise them enemies: From whom as oft he saves them penitent By Judges first, then under", "Kings; of whom The second, both for pietie renownd And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne For ever shall endure; the like shall sing All Prophecie, That of the Royal Stock Of David (so I name this King) shall rise A Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold, Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings The last, for of his Reign shall be no end. But first a long succession must ensue, And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam\u2019d, The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents Wandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine. Such follow him, as shall be registerd Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle, Whose foul Idolatries, and other faults Heapt to the popular summe, will so incense God, as to leave them, and expose thir Land, Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey To that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw\u2019st Left in confusion, Babylon thence call\u2019d. There in captivitie he lets them dwell The space of seventie years, then brings them back, Remembring mercie, and his Cov\u2019nant sworn To David, stablisht as the dayes of Heav\u2019n. Returnd from Babylon by leave of Kings Thir Lords, whom God dispos\u2019d, the house of God They first re- edifie, and for a while In mean estate live moderate, till grown In wealth and multitude, factious they grow; But first among the Priests dissension springs, Men who attend the Altar, and should most Endeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings Upon the Temple it self: at last they seise The Scepter, and regard not Davids Sons, Then loose it to a stranger, that the true Anointed King Messiah might be born Barr\u2019d of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr Unseen before in Heav\u2019n proclaims him com, And guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire His place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold; His place of birth a solemn Angel tells To simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night; They gladly thither haste, and by a Quire Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung. A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire The Power of the most High; he shall ascend The Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav\u2019ns. He ceas\u2019d, discerning Adam with such joy Surcharg\u2019d, as had like grief bin dew\u2019d in tears, Without the vent of words, which these he breathd. O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher Of utmost hope! now clear I understand What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain, Why our great expectation should be call\u2019d The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile, High in the love of Heav\u2019n, yet from my Loynes Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son Of God most High; So God with man unites. Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise Expect with mortal paine: say where", "and when Thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel. To whom thus Michael. Dream not of thir fight, As of a Duel, or the local wounds Of head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil Thy enemie; nor so is overcome Satan, whose fall from Heav\u2019n, a deadlier bruise, Disabl\u2019d not to give thee thy deaths wound: Which hee, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure, Not by destroying Satan, but his works In thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be, But by fulfilling that which thou didst want, Obedience to the Law of God, impos\u2019d On penaltie of death, and suffering death, The penaltie to thy transgression due, And due to theirs which out of thine will grow: So onely can high Justice rest appaid. The Law of God exact he shall fulfill Both by obedience and by love, though love Alone fulfill the Law; thy punishment He shall endure by coming in the Flesh To a reproachful life and cursed death, Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe In his redemption, and that his obedience Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits To save them, not thir own, though legal works. For this he shall live hated, be blasphem\u2019d, Seis\u2019d on by force, judg\u2019d, and to death condemnd A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life; But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies, The Law that is against thee, and the sins Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi\u2019d, Never to hurt them more who rightly trust In this his satisfaction; so he dies, But soon revives, Death over him no power Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light, Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems, His death for Man, as many as offerd Life Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace By Faith not void of works: this God-like act Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy\u2019d, In sin for ever lost from life; this act Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes, And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel, Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep, A gentle wafting to immortal Life. Nor after resurrection shall he stay Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer To his Disciples, Men who in his Life Still follow\u2019d him; to them shall leave in charge To teach all nations what of him they learn\u2019d And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve Baptizing in the profluent streame, the signe Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life Pure, and in mind prepar\u2019d, if so befall, For death, like that which the redeemer dy\u2019d. All Nations they shall teach; for from that day Not onely to", "the Sons of Abrahams Loines Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons Of Abrahams Faith wherever through the world; So in his seed all Nations shall be blest. Then to the Heav\u2019n of Heav\u2019ns he shall ascend With victory, triumphing through the aire Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines Through all his realme, & there confounded leave; Then enter into glory, and resume His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high Above all names in Heav\u2019n; and thence shall come, When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe, With glory and power to judge both quick & dead, To judge th\u2019 unfaithful dead, but to reward His faithful, and receave them into bliss, Whether in Heav\u2019n or Earth, for then the Earth Shall all be Paradise, far happier place Then this of Eden, and far happier daies. So spake th\u2019 Archangel Michael, then paus\u2019d, As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire Replete with joy and wonder thus repli\u2019d. O goodness infinite, goodness immense! That all this good of evil shall produce, And evil turn to good; more wonderful Then that which by creation first brought forth Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand, Whether I should repent me now of sin By mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring, To God more glory, more good will to Men From God, and over wrauth grace shall abound. But say, if our deliverer up to Heav\u2019n Must reascend, what will betide the few His faithful, left among th\u2019 unfaithful herd, The enemies of truth; who then shall guide His people, who defend? will they not deale Wors with his followers then with him they dealt? Be sure they will, said th\u2019 Angel; but from Heav\u2019n Hee to his own a Comforter will send, The promise of the Father, who shall dwell His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith Working through love, upon thir hearts shall write, To guide them in all truth, and also arme With spiritual Armour, able to resist Satans assaults, and quench his fierie darts What Man can do against them, not affraid, Though to the death, against such cruelties With inward consolations recompenc\u2019t, And oft supported so as shall amaze Thir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit Powrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends To evangelize the Nations, then on all Baptiz\u2019d, shall them with wondrous gifts endue To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles, As did thir Lord before them. Thus they win Great numbers of each Nation to receave With joy the tidings brought from Heav\u2019n: at length Thir Ministry perform\u2019d, and race well run, Thir doctrine and thir story written left, They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne, Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves, Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav\u2019n To thir own vile advantages shall turne Of lucre and ambition, and the truth With", "superstitions and traditions taint, Left onely in those written Records pure, Though not but by the Spirit understood. Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names, Places and titles, and with these to joine Secular power, though feigning still to act By spiritual, to themselves appropriating The Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv\u2019n To all Beleevers; and from that pretense, Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild His living Temples, built by Faith to stand, Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard Infallible? yet many will presume: Whence heavie persecution shall arise On all who in the worship persevere Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part, Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes Religion satisfi\u2019d; Truth shall retire Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on, To good malignant, to bad men benigne, Under her own waight groaning, till the day Appeer of respiration to the just, And vengeance to the wicked, at return Of him so lately promis\u2019d to thy aid, The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold, Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord, Last in the Clouds from Heav\u2019n to be reveald In glory of the Father, to dissolve Satan with his perverted World, then raise From the conflagrant mass, purg\u2019d and refin\u2019d, New Heav\u2019ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date Founded in righteousness and peace and love, To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss. He ended; and thus Adam last reply\u2019d. How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest, Measur\u2019d this transient World, the Race of time, Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss, Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach. Greatly instructed I shall hence depart, Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill Of knowledge, what this vessel can containe; Beyond which was my folly to aspire. Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best, And love with feare the onely God, to walk As in his presence, ever to observe His providence, and on him sole depend, Merciful over all his works, with good Still overcoming evil, and by small Accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake Is fortitude to highest victorie, And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life; Taught this by his example whom I now Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest. To whom thus also th\u2019 Angel last repli\u2019d: This having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Starrs Thou knewst by name, and all th\u2019 ethereal Powers, All secrets of the deep, all Natures works, Or works of God in Heav\u2019n, Air,", "Earth, or Sea, And all the riches of this World enjoydst, And all the rule, one Empire; onely add Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith, Add Vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love, By name to come call\u2019d Charitie, the soul Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess A Paradise within thee, happier farr. Let us descend now therefore from this top Of Speculation; for the hour precise Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards, By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword, In signal of remove, waves fiercely round; We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve; Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm\u2019d Portending good, and all her spirits compos\u2019d To meek submission: thou at season fit Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard, Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know, The great deliverance by her Seed to come (For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind. That ye may live, which will be many dayes, Both in one Faith unanimous though sad, With cause for evils past, yet much more cheer\u2019d With meditation on the happie end. He ended, and they both descend the Hill; Descended, Adam to the Bowre where Eve Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak\u2019t; And thus with words not sad she him receav\u2019d. Whence thou returnst, & whither wentst, I know; For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise, Which he hath sent propitious, some great good Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress VVearied I fell asleep: but now lead on; In mee is no delay; with thee to goe, Is to stay here; without thee here to stay, Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee Art all things under Heav\u2019n, all places thou, VVho for my wilful crime art banisht hence. This further consolation yet secure I carry hence; though all by mee is lost, Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft, By mee the Promis\u2019d Seed shall all restore. So spake our Mother Eve, and Adam heard VVell pleas\u2019d, but answer\u2019d not; for now too nigh Th\u2019 Archangel stood, and from the other Hill To thir fixt Station, all in bright array The Cherubim descended; on the ground Gliding meteorous, as Ev\u2019ning Mist Ris\u2019n from a River o\u2019re the marish glides, And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel Homeward returning. High in Front advanc\u2019t, The brandisht Sword of God before them blaz\u2019d Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat, And vapour as the Libyan Air adust, Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat In either hand the hastning Angel caught Our lingring Parents, and to th\u2019 Eastern Gate Let them direct, and down the Cliff as fast To the subjected Plaine; then disappeer\u2019d. They looking back, all th\u2019 Eastern side beheld Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat, Wav\u2019d over by that flaming Brand, the Gate With dreadful Faces throng\u2019d and fierie Armes: Som", "natural tears they drop\u2019d, but wip\u2019d them soon; The World was all before them, where to choose Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide: They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow, Through Eden took thir solitarie way.
